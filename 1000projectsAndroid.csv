He/she used to search in books whether the client has to pay any amount in past and how much quantity of material still remaining in the shop. He uses a calculator to calculate the total amount of the bill. Disadvantages of the existing system  Time-consuming. Waste of paper. Difficult to search and remember the details.  Proposed system The proposed system aim is to reduce the difficulty of remembering the details and manage the shop details easily. Advantages of the proposed system  Less time-consuming. No paperwork. No use of Calculator. Reduce human effort.  Specific Requirements Common Interfaces Requirements Hardware Interfaces • Input and output data are stored on the SQL Server 2014 database server. • Development must support at least version 4.0 of Android. Functional Requirements Images of an example of what should be the requirements are attached in the next chapter. Login The application will ask for a username and password, previously created in the Database. The system must ensure that the username and password are valid, which otherwise will be left to the user in the login screen. Client Module • Enter this module list clients created with the value of the debt. • You will have an option of creating customers where would deploy the user a screen where it will ask the following information: Or required fields: name, Aadhar, phone, address, email address and gender. Or non-obligatory data: the value of the initial debt. By default must be zero. In the creation of the client should be validated by the number of identification card there is no customer. • Created client list must have an option to edit customer data, in where it will display a window with the data of the client, allowing you to modify all data except for identification card and the value of the initial debt. • Allow client search by the following filters: name and identification card. • Whenever client doesn’t money to pay bill his debt will add to his details. Supplier Module • This module you enter providers that are created, data listed are as follows: Nit, the name of the manufacturer or distributor, a balance which is due. • It will have a choice of provider creating, selecting this option would deploy a window to the user where requests the following information: or – mandatory data: Nit., name, phone, address, visit (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.) this field is multiple selections and frequency of visits (weekly, fortnightly and monthly. or Optional data: name of contact and contact phone. • When user unable to pay the total amount to supplier he can save the debt amount in this whenever required. • The date when supplier last visit also record here. Inventory Module • Upon entering this module it lists the products created in the store. The following will show code of the product, the product description, quantity in the inventory, the price of sale and utility value. • You will have a choice of creating the product. Selecting this option show the user a window where will ask for the following information: or barcode: mandatory, to enter this field the system must validate if the product exists in the teacher’s products, if any product, you must bring the following information: name, group and line or name: required field. It is the name of the product or unit of measure: optional field. This field is for fruit and vegetable products. It allows selecting the type of measurement that will be used for the product (Kg and G) none for soap or others. It is not a mandatory field. or purchase price: required field. It is the purchase price of the product. or sale price: required field. It is the selling price of the product. or quantity: required field. It is the amount that is the product. or VAT: optional field. It is the value of VAT on the product. To create the product are: • You will have an option to edit the product. Selecting this option will display the product data and allows to edit the following details: price sale, purchase price, taxes and supplier. • You will have an option to search for products, search filters are as follows: barcode, name, internal code and provider. • You will have an option to filter the list of products. The filters that you can arrange Products. • Upon creating the product user need to arrange the product into his inventory. The first shop does not have any goods or products so the user needs to transfer his data from product module to the inventory module. Upon clicking the inventory module user will able to see his products which are present in his shop but not in the storeroom. He able to sell the items which are present in the inventory because the sales module navigate screen to inventory module only. So he needs to transfer shop products from storeroom to inventory. • From product module user able to transfer products to inventory by entering the following data Mandatory:-Quantity. Not-Mandatory:-Unit of Measurement. Or any changes. • Unit of measurement (UOM) is not mandatory because for bananas and sugar UOM is not the same. Sales Module • Allows to associate a client with the sale, the customer can be one registered (should be selected from a drop-down list) or one casual which is by default when this module is loaded. • Be permitted creating users and payment of debt, as described in the customer module • The user can register products on sale by either: Or through a reader of the barcode in which case the screen the product price. Whenever You read the product is adding to the amount of reading product. Or manually, where the user must have the following filters: name, barcode, code Internal and the last 4 numbers of the barcode. When you select the product, will add the product on sale. • Maybe delete some proceeds from the sale. Whenever you add a product on sale system calculate the Subtotal of sale, VAT and total sale. • Should be allowed to change the quantities and price of a product manually. If the price is modified, this should not affect the price registered in the catalogue of products. However, if it should be recorded in the sales. • At the end of the sale the user may choose different means of payment which are: Effective: would deploy a window with the total of the sale, a field to enter the value which is paying customer and a calculated field of change where it is calculated: the value paid by the customer, less the total of the sale. This single payment method may be by customers of the store, for an occasional client does not appear this payment method. When you select this payment method displays a summary of the sale: the total sale, the name of the client and the client’s debt total. The system must add the total of the sale to the client’s debt. • Discount value reduces the actual price cost. • At the end of the sale system must subtract the quantities of each product in inventory. • At the end of the sale system allows printing the invoice, where detailed invoice number, product, price, quantities and the total value of the sale. • At the end of the sale system allow to modify and update the inventory module. Login Details • The time when the user last login details saved details as follows Username, Date, Time. Non-Functional Requirements Performance Requirement The Proposed system that we are going to develop will be used as a chief performance system in supermarkets. Therefore, it is expected that the database will perform functionally all the requirements specified by the user. More Informative The application is more informative because more information is stored in the database than paper stored information.

15,http://1000projects.org/encryption-and-decryption-of-data-on-images-android-project.html,encryption and decryption of data on images android project.," Android is a software platform and operating system for mobile devices. This is a project that is used to perform secret data transmission by performing encryption of text on images. The sender uses a key to perform encryption and the same key is given to the receiver to decrypt and obtain the data. INTRODUCTION Encryption of data on images provides a safe and secure transmission of data between the sending and receiving party. The data/text which the sender wants to transmit is selected first and then an image is chosen from the current mobile device. The chosen text is then encrypted in the image such that the data is not visible to any third party. After encryption is performed, the image is sent to receiving party and the receiver decrypts the data using the key given by the sender. This decryption process can only be performed by an authenticated receiver using this application.           OBJECTIVE Main objective of this application is to provide a secure and secret transmission of text by encrypting it on an image using a key and which can only be decrypted by by an authenticated receiver using the same key on the same application. KEY FUNCTIONALITY • Start • Chosen text/retrieve data from current device • Browse an image from the device • Encrypt the chosen text onto the image • This image is sent to the receiver • Receiver now decrypts the data SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS: Java, JDK, Android SDK, My Eclipse Android Mobile Device Data Flow Diagram:  Class Diagram:  Activity Diagram:  Sequence Diagram:  Use Case Diagram:  Collaboration Diagram:  INTRODUCTION Existing system with limitations The perspective of data security, which has always been an important aspect of quality of service, Cloud Computing inevitably, poses new challenging security threats fornumber of reasons. Encryption of data/text was previously done using hash and cryptographic algorithms, which is written in binary form. Such encryption techniques are visible in a specific form and the intruder who is aware of binary text formats can easily read the text. In those times it provided a lot of security but as technology progressed many hackers also came into existence and it could not provide security upto that extent. Proposed system with features: In this project we used many techniques to encrypt and make the data in-visible to any one(not even to the receiver). We used LSB (Least Significant Bit) format, stenography and cryptographic techniques to encrypt the data and the data/text being encrypted on an image will not be visible. The sender will use a key for security reasons and the same key should be used by receiving party to decrypt the image and obtain the text written on it. The image on which data encryption is being performed can be chosen from the existing device and after all the process completes, that image can be sent through Bluetooth or mail or google drive e.t.c., Output Results:      Download Encryption and Decryption of Data on Images Android Project Code, Project Report Documentation.

16,http://1000projects.org/emergency-caller-android-app-project.html,emergency caller android app project.," Abstract: In case of any emergency patient may not be a state of speaking with anyone or searching through the contact list and calling the desired person, hence we are making an application to solve this problem. The Emergency Caller Android App is needed in case of a medical emergency. The user can make an emergency call to the nearest hospital. The user of the application needs to configure the application for the first time use where the user will fill in a short medical survey (that will help to generate a medical history of the patient). In case of emergency the system will find out the nearest hospital based on the current location of the user and the call will be initiated also the medical details about the patient will be sent to the hospital.           The call will contain a pre-recorded message by the user and the location of the user which will be detected by google maps and then the information will be converted to the voice message. The Novelty of Idea: As the Patient’s basic information is available with hospital beforehand the kind of treatment to be given will be decided in advance and the patient can be treated immediately as soon as he/she arrives. Relevance and Applications: The system will help the user when he is in an emergency and importantly not in his own area ( Some not well-known place for the user). In case of emergency as mentioned above it is not possible for a user to speak and also if there is no one nearby to help, the situation can become worst. Solution: Technology Layer/Solution Attached is the diagram  Proof of Concepts: As of now, we have used a google maps basic example (rendering map) and soon we will be finding nearest hospital based on users current location and prepare a voice message. Research & Development: Designing the UI in such a way that will solve the purpose in the least number of clicks. what kind of information to store about the patient that will help to generate a medical history of the patient, depending on the storage are (phone/cloud). In order to make the system more lively, we are planning to use the cloud to store patients information that will be sent to the hospital in case of emergency. We will try to figure out some shortcut ( gesture, tapping, pressing screen ) in order to initiate emergency help. Improvement on Existing Solution: In the current Situation, it becomes very difficult for a patient to locate a nearby hospital in case of emergency but with the help of this android app, we can find nearby hospitals easily.

Once a particular product has been found then the seller gets interacted with the buyer by this application. In the existing system, the selling and buying of waste materials are done manually, where the customer visit the shop for selling the items, he couldn’t compare prices with the other stores and only a limited customers visit the store. To overcome these defects, the Dustbin project has been implemented.           The proposed Dustbin App allows the visitors to buy waste materials online. They can view the contents at any time. It automatically calculates the grand total and the details of buyer or seller sent as SMS to visitor. The customers can sell their waste by sitting in home, large quantity can be sold and it is a user-friendly interface. This Dustbin – Waste Material Management project is a small step to reduce the communication between the buyers and sellers. These types of applications would be of great use for the waste material users to find the sellers easily in the sense that they can reduce their work of searching for the sellers.

46,http://1000projects.org/streaming-using-smartphone-relay-via-bluetooth.html,streaming using smartphone relay via bluetooth.," Introduction: Bluetooth connectivity in smartphones has a range. It varies from 10 – 12 meters. So, if two smartphones want to connect and the distance is more than the above mentioned figure, the main concept behind the problem statement arises. Problem Statement:            Two devices (tablet or smart-phone), which cannot communicate directly due to distance will use a 3rd device in between them to communicate. Using the relay, one device should be able to stream music or video from another device. Relay: A relay is nothing but a connecter which will act as a middle person and helps in transmitting data between devices which cannot communicate due to distance. It is just like a courier guy who delivers your mail from source to destination. As shown in the figure above, the problem statement is properly depicted. An android application which connects 3 smart phones acting as sender receiver and relay and the receiver can stream music from the sender’s device. Abstract: An android application “Music Share” which will enable 3 smart phones namely A, B and C to stream music from the sender to the receiver via the relay. The relay will first connect to the sender. Thereafter, a connection will be made with the receiver. Once the connection is established, the sender will send a music file to the relay. The relay will convert the file into bytes, and a byte array is formed. This is stored in a temporary file in the relay and is sent to the receiver which is also connected to the relay. When sufficient amount of the data is sent, and the play button is pressed, the file is played which was originally stored in the sender. This is the overview of how the application works. It is explained in detail in the following sections. Proposed Solution: Developing an android application which will have the functionality of sender, receiver and relay. This application will have simple user interface which will guide the user to use the functionalities of sender, receiver and relay. Sender will have the functionality to connect to the relay via all the Bluetooth paired devices. The relay will be acting as a bridge, which will connect, to the sender as well as the receiver. The receiver will be connected to the relay and when it gets connected to the relay it will connect to sender hence forming a chain. When this chain is established the receiver will get the list songs that are in the storage of the sender device and it will be displayed on the receiver device. Now, when you select the name of the song that you want to play it will start fetching the song from the sender device. When you hit the play button it will start playing the streamed song on the device. Architecture: We have implemented a three-tier architecture which have a UI and that UI is connected to the backend logic which we used to make the application functional. We used a database which was connected to the backend logic. In this application when we open our application we come across a screen where we have to select whether we want our device to be sender, relay or receiver. If we have entered in the database whether the given device is sender, relay or receiver then the device automatically adapts that role and the respective screen opens. Now for the sender application we have created a class name “Sender.java”. This class has all the functionalities that are required by the sender class to connect to the relay and send the data from sender to relay. Initially when we open the sender UI, we can see a list view which is populated with the paired Bluetooth device present in the system. If the Bluetooth device is not paired with each other then we have to pair them manually. Once they are paired they will appear in the list view. When you click on the list view one a connection socket is created and a socket request is send to the relay device using the Bluetooth MAC address. Once the sender requests a connection the relay accepts the connection request opening Bluetooth socket connection request from the sender device. Now the whole functionality of the relay device is written in two classes ‘Relay.java’ and ‘ThreadToBeConnected.java’. In ‘Relay.java’ we are accepting the connection and opens up a connection with the sender device. Once it is establish it also accepts a list of names of files of songs from the sender device. The above-mentioned things are done on one thread and the other thread tries establishing the connection with the receiver device. The connection is established as it was established between sender and relay. Now when the receiver establishes the connection with the relay it will accept the list of files and send the request of back to the receiver. Once the request is sent to the relay two new threads start. One thread will start fetching the data from the sender via file input output stream it will pass that data to the receiver. This all will be handled by the ‘TheadToBeConnected.java’ class. Now when the receiver accepts the connection from the relay, it will get a list view from the sender it will populate its list view. Now, when you click on the name of the song it will send a request to relay. When it starts accepting the data from the relay, it will generate a temporary file. This temporary file will be then used to stream the data. Challenges: • We were new to android and hence we need to learn how to develop an android applications. Hence we needed to go through a lot of android tutorials and YouTube videos. • How the Bluetooth can connect between two devices and how to transfer the data via a Bluetooth? As a result of this we came to know that Bluetooth can be connected between two devices using a socket connection. Once the connection is established we can send the data over to the next device using input output stream, until the connection stays open. • How to transfer the file from one device to other device? We came to know that the file transfer can be done using the byte array. So created a byte array and used to transfer that byte array while transferring the file. This solved the problem of copying the file from one device to another device. • Streaming a file created problems? When we used to write a byte array in a temporary file with a chunk of data it created a lot of noise and the playback was not smooth. So we used to send a chunk of data and while writing the data on the temporary file we used to write it byte by byte. • Creating relay functionality? The functionality of relay was not difficult to understand but was very difficult to implement. First we used to create a temporary file on the relay device but then the data was not transferred as we wanted it to be. So then we created two different threads and did synchronization on those to thread, which made the streaming smooth. The chunk of data from sender was received by relay on one thread and the other thread used to take that same data and send that data to the receiver. In this way the relay functionality was implemented. Drawbacks: There are a few drawbacks about this application. They can be worked up on in the future making the application more dynamic. They are listed as follows: 1. Socket connection for Bluetooth versions were not supported in different android versions. This means that this application will not work if one smart phone is lollipop version and another is kit Kat version. This can be included in the future work of the application. 2. The application uses a static Database and the values of the smart phones are inserted manually. This means that the MAC addresses of the smart phones and their names are added manually. So, we want to connect a new device, we have to manually remove one of the phone add the address and the name of the new phone. Therefore, we can’t dynamically add any device directly using the Bluetooth. 3. The file name and the owner name have to be mentioned in the code manually. 4. There should be only one song in the sender phonei.e. only 1 .mp3 file in the sender phone. If there is more than one .mp3 file in the sender file, the application crashes immediately. Thus these are the drawbacks and can be included in the future work. How to install the application: There are two ways you can install the app: 1. You can open the code in eclipse and then ‘RUN AS’ on the devices you want. But before you do so you need to make the devices are in the developer mode. 2. You can also push the musicshare.apk to android phones which is present in the bin folder of the code sent to you before. How to run the application: For instance, if you use the second method, i.e. pushing an apk (music share) to all 3 android devices. Make sure all 3 devices have same android version. Then, open the apk in all 3 phones. Select one phone as sender, one phone as relay and other as receiver. In sender phone, select the Bluetooth MAC address of the relay phone which is to be connected. Once the sender connection is established with relay, next establish the connection from relay to receiver. After successful connection, the receiver will get the list of music files present in the sender and it requests for a music file. After significant bytes are transmitted form sender to receiver through relay, the receiver can play the music file. Conclusion: With the help of Bluetooth sockets and all other techniques explained above, we successfully implemented our project “Streaming using Smartphones as relay.” References: • http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7273084/how-to-programatically-connect-2-android-devices-with-bluetooth • http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth.html • http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18109479/howt-to-connect-two-devices-via-bluetooth-sending-the-pairng-code-by-parameter • http://www.glowingpigs.com/index.php/extras            "

Here in this project we set a code which is itself a password and this code must be sent in the form of message from another mobile. This application can be installed in any android mobiles. It is a project that you can able to find the location of a mobile which is been lost or missed. Our application can be very useful to the user because it is the only application that can trace the exact location of the mobile.           Our application must be installed in the mobile whose location is to be traced and in our application a code is been set. When our mobile is lost or missed we send a message with code to the lost mobile from another mobile, the application on receiving the message checks whether it matches with the code. If it matches then it sends a message containing the location to the sender’s mobile number. This application works in background and the user cannot find this application on the mobile screen though it is installed in that mobile.This application will be supported by all the network providers. This application makes use of GPS services and internet services in the mobile. For developing this application, we use components like broadcast receiver(), service() ,etc. Existing system limitations:  The current system has no application to track the location of the mobile through an SMS. In the previous projects the message sent will be sent as a normal message to the other mobile . But there is no application developed for location tracking automatically by receiving a predefined message without the user’s permission. Proposed system with features:  In this project we are proposing a new form of messaging to get the location back as a reply automatically. In this project we will send a Message to my mobile, it will authenticate the message and reply the location if code is matched. The main feature of the proposed system is, we are developing an application in such a way that it tracks the exact location of a mobile. For this application we are using features like broadcast receiver (), service (), etc. This application makes use of internet services, GPS services in the mobile and based on this services it gets the location and sends it to the message sender’s phone number. Our application can be very useful to the user because it is the only application that can trace the exact location of the mobile.

Maturity detection is very important for fruit farmhouses. This Fruit Maturity Android Application pretends to apply image processing techniques to identify the degree of maturity in fruit. We present a method of maturity detection for fruits using the color data of fruit. We proposed standard time period for fruit to ripe. According to that time period, fruit status is checked.           INTRODUCTION Agriculture is an important sector in an economy that provides basic needs and food for human beings. The role of information technology has increased the potential of agriculture sector by using automated system in various activities. Computer vision, machine vision and image processing are various techniques used in the development of an automated system to serve different purposes. In recent decades, image processing has become an inevitable area in agricultural sector as it acts as an expert system with decision support system. Input image taken in real time is processed and transformed into useful information as an output to support farmer. This Fruit Maturity Android project pretends to apply image processing techniques to identify the degree of maturity in oranges identifying physical characteristics that determine fruit maturity and thus obtain a proper classification system, using benchmarks, complying with the standard CODEX where the quality criteria of the commercial varieties of oranges are specified. For the development of this android application will are using the image processing techniques for RGB parameters that can be used to perform characterization of maturity of oranges , conditioning of the image being carried out by pre – processing the image applying filters to control lighting and shadows that may affect the image analysis . STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM We propose image processing technique in order to identify ripen fruit using colour sensor. We will find time period for fruit to get ripen. We propose standard time period for fruit to ripe. According to that time period, fruit status is checked. We will calculate volume of fruit. OBJECTIVES OF THE SYSTEM To propose a computer vision and image analysis program. To find easy and suitable technique for external fruit inspection this android application, is presented a classification system oranges from image processing to identify the degree of ripeness of the fruit and make a standardized classification, for the development of this application are implemented conditioning algorithms, digital image processing, segmentation and obtaining of characteristics with patterns of color defined. PROPOSED SYSTEM This Fruit Maturity Android Application project will be used a camera image sensor and a means of acquiring information, the image processing techniques for RGB parameters that can be used to perform characterization of maturity of oranges, conditioning of the image being carried out by pre-processing the image applying filters to control lighting and shadows that may affect the image analysis. SCOPE OF WORK In developing this Fruit Maturity Android Application project, is presented a classification system oranges from image processing to identify the degree of ripeness of the fruit and make a standardized classification, for the development of this application are implemented conditioning algorithms, digital image processing, segmentation and obtaining of characteristics with patterns of color defined. LIMITATIONS For the development of this Fruit Maturity Android Application project will be used a camera image sensor and a means of acquiring information, the image processing techniques for RGB parameters that can be used to perform characterization of maturity of oranges, conditioning of the image being carried out by pre – processing the image applying filters to control lighting and shadows that may affect the image analysis. SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT  Language: – JAVA Tool: – sdk Platform: – Android Backend: – SQLite  EXISTING SYSTEM Maturity detection is very important for fruit farmhouses. There are many maturity detection methods, for example, usage of near-infrared rays or measuring the sugar concentration of fruits. However, the methods are sometimes expensive or may damage the fruits. It would therefore be potential to have low cost, simple treatment, and non-destructive methods. Many ripened fruits have sweet smell. In contrast, several immature fruits have no smell or bitter smell. It is therefore considered that sweet smell can be used for detecting the fruits maturity. Drawbacks of Existing System • The existing methods are sometimes expensive. • They may harmful or damage the fruits. SYSTEM DESIGN SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE To determine the maturity of the fruit we follow the method one by one. In this we first take an RGB input of fruit. After then divide this into B channel and R channel which further converted to R mask and B mask images of fruit. After taking intermediate mask from the R mask and B mask then take intermediate fruit area and intermediate color indices then removal of shadow area and final mask is taken which is combined with RGB input, final fruit area are obtained. Segmented fruit are taken from above image, take R channel and binary R of that image  Fig : Block Diagram for Maturity of Fruit Detection. NEED FOR THE SYSTEM In developing this Fruit Maturity project, is a presented classification system orange from image processing to identify the degree of ripeness of the fruit and make a standardized classification, for the development of this application are implemented conditioning algorithms, digital image processing, segmentation and obtaining of characteristics with patterns of color defined, in the software. For the development of this Fruit Maturity project will be used a camera image sensor and a means of acquiring information, the image processing will be developed in the software using image processing techniques for RGB parameters that can be used to perform characterization of maturity of oranges, conditioning of the image being carried out by pre – processing the image applying filters to control lighting and shadows that may affect the image analysis. DATA FLOW DIAGRAM  E-R DIAGRAM  CLASS DIAGRAM  USE CASE DIAGRAM  USER: The user should do registration if they are using this application first time after this they have to login and then the user should upload the fruit image. SYSTEM: After recognize the image by RGB ratio it will display the results. SEQUENCE DIAGRAM  FRUIT: Upload the fruit. CAMERA: The camera will capture and read the image and after it will estimate the RGB value of the fruit. COLOUR: The color after estimating the RGB value it will compute the RG ratio and then display the results. ACTIVITY DIAGRAM SCREEN SHOTS  Screen shot for start the usage of app.    Screen shot for Shop name.    Screen shot for adding a photo.    Screen shot for adding a photo.   CONCLUSION Through image processing can identify fruit characteristics in order to optimize selection processes in the agricultural industry. Applying image processing techniques is possible establish fixed maturity parameters of a fruit and thereby increase the quality of fruit sorting. Using image processing in real time is possible improve and increase production in various industries focused in the classification and selection beginning with defined characteristics. With systematized classification techniques, is can establish an objective classification of a product, mainly agricultural products where selection in most cases is subjective. FUTURE ENHANCEMENT In the future, we propose new ideas to know the ripeness of all fruits or the bunch of same type fruits or other types of fruits or the health and life of a plant.            "

To avoid this disturbance  We need an Period bell Android Application to be present in the mobile of every staff/management of the campus which will ring a bell as per the periods. There are cases where the time table slots are different for different classes hence there should be a provision to feed the time table in the app of that specific user and his bell will ring as per his time-table.           The bell should ring only if the student is in the campus I.e. his location should be traced and then decision should be taken.

78,http://1000projects.org/e-commerce-web-application-mobile-interface.html,e commerce web application mobile interface.," Abstract Internet is the most used source for businesses and shopping. Online shopping is an extension for business owners to sell their products and increase profits. This increases the sales and profits of the business and then coming to the technology we need to have the ease of access for shopping online. The huge competition between the several types of e-commerce applications. This is an E-commerce application for selling products online. The types of products are customizable and variety of sale. The robustness and scalability of the application are being the most important factors. Hence, the framework and coding are done using ASP.NET and C#. This brings to a conclusion of also developing a smart phone application in windows and Android. As, there are majority of users for Smartphone, they prefer shopping using an Smartphone application.             Introduction  Today, Internet is the most used source for businesses and shopping. Online shopping is an extension for business owners to sell their products and increase profits. The complete collaboration of business, internet and software comes under a common term E-commerce Technically, Electronic commerce defines as a term used for buying and selling products using electronic systems such as computers, networks and Internet. This completely involves the developing of software applications, marketing, selling, shares and business. This project, titled as Building ‘E-commerce Web Application with Mobile  Interface’ develops an E-commerce web application which contains several options to buy, sell and display products. The project also includes showing an admin panel, to control sales and inventory. The project description section describes clearly each and every module of the web application. There also exists a android / Iphone mobile interface of the following application in form of windows and android mobile applications. The reason behind the development of smartphone application is because 56 Percentage of American people use a smartphone (Einav,2014). Having a mobile application will make them easy to surf different products and shop. The web application will be executed using a website domain and the mobile applications will be executed by the emulators. The Application also contains Databases, payment methods etc. The development process will be object oriented. The pages and the links of the application are given in project description section. All the project schedules and time taken for different steps in developing the application are given in other sections below. E-commerce web application is a live project which has lot of coding, architecture, database tables and interfaces.   Project Description  The project develops an E-commerce web application and am mobile phone application running on windows and Android. Using this website and mobile application people can start shopping online, buy goods and pay the amount. The project contains of two parts:  Website (or) Web Application Mobile Application in Android and Windows  Both the parts have almost similar interfaces and modules. The only difference is the ease of usage. They have a common database. The Software environment is described in another section of this proposal. These applications have various modules or pages, All the functions possible in this module are described separately. Each Module or function have a set of tasks to accomplish. The operation of this project is divided into two different interfaces. Commonly describes as the front-end and back-end of a website. In this Application we decide it as Customer Interface Admin Panel  Customer Interface   The customer interface is the page for customers to browse and search products. It is the page which is visible to the customers and users. It cannot make any changes to the website or the database. It is accessed by the end user to shop products and make payments. The Customer Interface contains of several functions and modules. Each module is defined separately with explanations. Similarly, the Admin panel have modules that are different from customer interface. The various modules or the functions of the Customer Interface part of the application are as follows: Responsive Web Interface (Mobile Friendly) The Web Interface is the physical part that can be seen and operated by the user on the website, it is the framework of the application, also called as the look of the web application. The better looking is the web interface; the more people would like to visit the website. Hence, it is one of the most important factor to increase sales. The word ‘Responsive’ states that the interface is friendly to different screens. This typically means, the website or the application used on various screen sizes would change its interface accordingly signifying the screen size. That means, the design for the website is different for Laptops, Smartphones, and Tablets. This is completely different from the smart phone application. Unlimited Products This module or functions states that there can be unlimited products listed for sale. There is no limitation for browsing the product. The products displayed should be in stock and shuld be available for sale for getting added in to the cart. Unlimited Product Categories As there are Unlimited Products, all the listed products would be in different categories, for making customers easy to browse products. For example, TV’s, refrigerators and so on are the category of Electronics, all the textiles are category of Clothing etc. Hence, the user or customer can select his or her choice of category and shop for products. There is no limitation in the categories of products also. Shopping Cart Application After shopping and browsing the products, the customers add the products to the cart (Shopping Cart). The cart application is coded in such a way, that it adds tax according to the given state. Also gives the option to pay the outstanding balances. It has an option for entering any codes for reducing prices such as gift cards or promotional cash, etc. The programming is similar for both the web application and Smartphone application. The shopping cart, should be secure and easy to understand. It should also have the number of products required and also the complete detailed billing information of the customer. The shipping address and billing address of the customer should be completed before check out. These information of the customer should be secure and this page should not have any loopholes in the code, that makes it easy for eavesdropping. Login and Sign Up Each and every user have separate profile in the application, which stores their recent orders, billing address and shipping addresses. Before checking out from the cart, Customers should login into their accounts. If they do not have an account or profile in the application, they should create one. The login and signup pages are forms, which are separate for each and every customer or user. These profiles are all saved in databases. The databases are designed in form of these profiles. It is not mandatory for having a profile, customers can also buy products using a guest checkout, which does not store any recent information, but stores the order using its order number. Display and E-mail Invoices After the Purchase of the products, an invoice is displayed and emailed to the given Email ID of the customer. This is coded in the programming part of the checkout page. The Invoice states the Order number, name, product details, date of purchase etc. Deals and Offers Whenever there is any deal or offer in any product it should be directly applied to the cart. Hence, this module should have good collection because people start looking into these pages first. Search Products This option is the most important of all the modules, because every customer types in the product he want in the search bar. To make the customer easy to search we add search filters. Search filters are used to make the search option even more better for fine and clear results. The search toolbar should not have any errors as this may decrease the patience of the customer. Tracking Shipped Products Customers should be able to track their products once the shipping from the ware house is done. These tracking is done in a third party shipping company. But we add a frame from the third party shipping company to make it easy for our customers to track their products. These are the modules and functions that are main part of the Customer Interface, all these modules make the site full online store for buying products. To manage all these customer interface modules we need to have a master admin. Hence, we add another part to our application that is the Admin Panel.  Admin Panel  To manage all the pages and modules in the Customer Interface it is important to have a back-end interface for the web application. The Modules in the Admin panel are completely different from Customer Interface. Each and every module is explained separately. Database All the customers and the users having profiles or accounts in the web application are saved in the user accounts database. All the products bought by the customers are stored separately in their accounts respectively. Product Database The unlimited products in the web application are added through the product database. Every product is added in the shopping list according to its respectful category. Update Prices and Banners Prices of the products change eventually, so admin panel should be able to update prices and banners. Banners are posters that are displayed in the home page for bringing up the deals and offers. Multiple Payment Gateways After adding products to cart, payments are made using the payment gateways. Hence, all gateways should be secure for making payments. Smartphone Application Interface The smartphone application’s interfaces are almost similar to the smartphone responsive web interface. It also has common database as the products and user profiles or accounts.   Project Activities  The Project activities involve steps for developing the web application. These activities can make the project, faster to develop and run easily. There are two different Project activities for Web and Smartphone Application.  Web Application Activities  The activities for Web Application are given as follows. Application Software Architecture Designing Database Tables Designing Framework for the Web Application Developing Code for running the parts of Application Implementation of the code using website domain Testing the Application for bugs and loopholes  Smartphone Application  The Activities involving for smart phone application development are given as follows: Application Software Architecture Designing Database Tables Coding for the Application The above two activities are similar to the Web Application activities. Designing framework for Smartphone Application Implementation using mobile emulators Testing and debugging the Smartphone application Respectively for Android and Windows   Project Environment  The project environment for both web and software applications are given as follows.

79,http://1000projects.org/smart-phone-book-android-application.html,smart phone book android application.," INTRODUCTION The main objective of Smart-Phone book Android application is to avoid confusion while searching for the names in the contact list. It is easy to save a contact but what if the number is different and the name of two persons is the same. The solution is to save the numbers with the same name but in two different fields. This application contains different fields, where contacts of people belonging to the particular field can be saved there.           By selecting the particular contact from the field or sub-field function like calling can be performed.  Abstract: The main objective of Smart-phonebook application is to avoid confusion while searching for the name in the contacts list. Creating a contact in our phonebook seems to be easy, but it becomes little confusing when we search for names in the contact list as two or more people may have the same name but different numbers. To avoid this confusion we have added few fields to currently existing phonebook which makes it a smart-phonebook. Fields like friend, family, work, relative as per the requirement are included in this application. This application will be very helpful for the people having a big list of contacts.  Requirements: Software :  Operating system: Windows 8.1pro Technology: Android Backend: Java SE Front end : XML(as UI) Tools: Android Studio or Android SDK  Hardware :  Processor: Intel®Core™ RAM : 1.0 GB-2.0GB Hard disk: 2 GB  Scope: This is an offline application which manages to save one’s, part of personal information like contact number, address and email id if applicable. It can be accessed by the phone use only. Every person has many contacts in their list but may or may not classify contacts into groups. Proposed system :  This offline phonebook application can save several numbers of contacts belonging to different fields. Fields can be named as per the user wish, suppose one field belongs to the business, then in business there may be many sub-fields, a person’s information belonging to one particular sub-field can be saved there. The prime advantage is that many people can be classified according to their fields or sub-fields to avoid confusion while retrieving the contact. To give a call to any person can be easily done without searching the whole list of contacts, we can directly shift to the field and sub-field of that contact and perform the task.   Contact Type Screen  Add Contact Screen  View Contact Type  Contact List Screen  Contact Settings Screen  Update Contact Screen  Update Showing Screen Existing system :  As for now, we have a normal phone book is on every phone. This is a phonebook application that can be used only in smartphones. The only drawback of this application is that the incoming call of the person with the same name belonging to different fields, cannot display the particular field of that person.  Virtual view :  Conclusion : A person having several contacts will enjoy the flavor of this application, because the members in their list may confuse the user with the similar name though belonging to different categories, to overcome this person to person can be classified according to their respective categories.

85,http://1000projects.org/android-breakout-game-application-development.html,android breakout game application development.," Problem Description: To create a brick break out game. In the Android Breakout game  the player can be able to break statically located bricks placed on the top of the screen using a ball. The ball keeps on moving from top to bottom. A paddle at the bottom can be used to change the direction of the ball and thus avoid the ball touching the ground.  If the ball touches the ground the player will lose the game but if the player break all the bricks then the player will be a winner. User’s Guide:           The Android Breakout game is delivered in a zip file called radnim-1_task3.zip. To run the application one must download the file and extract to a folder. Import the folder as an eclipse project (You must have android SDK installed in eclipse). After fixing the project setup, right click the folder and run as Android Application. When the application starts it will look like the figure 1. After all bricks are break as shown in fig.2 the player will see a winning message on the screen. If the ball touches the ground as shown in fig.4 the player will lose the game. However the player can press Play Again to play once again.  Algorithm Description There are 2 activities in the application. “MainActivity” which is loaded as soon as the application start. Another activity is “GameStatusActivity” which is used to display the result of the game (i.e if the player wins or lost). The “GameView” class contains the main logic related to the creation of bricks, ball and paddle. Each of them is created as an instance of “GameObject”. The “GameObject” has an instance of bitmap and the x, y coordinates. The “GameLogic” controls the status of the game. The game has 3 statuses (Running, Win, and Lost). This class extends the “Thread” class and overrides the run method. The update method in “GameView” has the logic to move the ball to a suitable position depending on the collision with wall, block or paddle. The collide method in the “GameObject” helps to identify if the ball is collided with other “GameObject” instances. The update method in the “GameObject” updates the x, y position of the ball. The onTouchEvent of “GameView” handles touch screen motion events. System Description Limitations There are many limitations in terms of look and feel. But one of the major limitation is sometimes the ball does not bounce back when it touch paddle. I tested several times but this occurs rarely and only once. I don’t understand the reason.  Also the ball don’t move horizontally when it touches the middle of any block or paddle. There is something to do with the x, y position of the ball, I tried but didn’t find a solution. Discussion Have not been in any discussions with in the forum. As I am very busy usually with my work and most of the conversations are in English. However I do read other students comments and ideas. They are really very helpful. Initially I tried to learn about the game development fundamentals. Later I followed the android forum that is very helpful.  Test runs  No tests are available to run.

89,http://1000projects.org/emergency-call-android-project.html,emergency call android project.," The main scope of the “emergency call” app is to call and as well as message (SMS) the present location where we are, to certain selected contacts by activating the app on to the home screen. Another aim is to repeat the same process i.e. calling and message sending after 15mins to the other contact. This is the best featured app because, for every 15mins the call will be connecting to the alternate numbers selected. In the same way message in the form of sms i.e. the location will be sent to every number. This will help when the previous call is disconnected or does not respond after 15mins it will be connecting to the other contact selected and followed by location in the form of sms.            As we can run this app when we unlock theAndroid mobile and as soon as we hold and lift our finger from the app button on the home screen, the app will start working. So, there will be no chances of operating the “emergency call” app unknowingly. “Emergency call” app is the quick and safe app because, as we unlock the mobile and on the home screen only we can run the app.  EXISTING SYSTEM: In the existing applications we have a button on the screen when it the Android mobile is in lock mode. DISADVANTAGES OF EXISTING SYSTEM: Here, the disadvantages are: There are chances of running the application unknowingly, because when the screen is locked then only we can run the application. Existing system do not have the extra features like “location sending and repeating the process after 15mins again”. PROPOSED SOLUTION: We can use the application on the home screen. so that, there will be no chances on running the app unknowingly. In this we have the extra features like “location sending and repeating the process after 15mins again”. MODULES USED IN THE PROJECT  USER MODULE LOCATION MODULE MESSAGE MODULE  Problem Definition: In the entire world of technology, mobiles are playing a major role in almost every corner. As new models of mobiles are coming in day-by-day, the technology and applications are also increasing. Android is an open source for developing new applications as people expecting new technologies and applications in the mobiles. As our project is on “Emergency call”. Problem definition we cannot know when the application is running, because the app in the mobile will be running on the lock mode and Existing system does not have the extra features like “location sending and repeating the process after 15mins again”. Proposed Solution: Generally, in almost every mobile there will be speed dial option. But in our app of “Emergency call” we can activate the app before going into a emergency situation. This helps us in doing our work sooner and faster. When your Android mobile is locked with the default pattern, its easier to open and call to an emergency contact. Emergency calls to services such as 1-0-8, 1-0-0 and any of your contact number are accessible. The phone will allow you to make as many emergency calls as needed. The Android phones will only dial emergency calls which ever we assign and the location in message format. In the Android OS, we can create shortcuts to emergency numbers as well as take it a step further with the Maps app. The main scope of the “emergency call” app is to call and as well as message (sms) i.e. the location at present to certain selected contacts by activating the app on to the home screen. This is the best featured app because, for every 15 mins the call will be connecting to the alternate numbers selected. In the same way message in the form of sms i.e. the location will be sent to every number. In the emergency situation we do not have the time to search and dial a number. So we can simply click on to a button and make a call and send the present location where we are. This will help when the previous call is disconnected or doesn’t respond after 15 mins it will be connecting to the other contact selected and followed by location in the form of sms. Proposed Solution is that we can run the application on the home screen and we also have the extra features like “location sending and repeating the process after 15 mins again”.

Designing an application in mobile devices is totally different from the desktop system because of their configurations. Researches still developing different techniques for managing attendance in organizations. We have to design our application in such a way that it can work in heterogeneous systems for these we use XML files and JAVA for client-server applications and database access. Generally Oracle and My SQL will be used in database concept, because they support different Operating systems and data types. Attendance is a basic task in each area, when the strength is low no problem to manage but in case when it is more it is most complex to manage the data. But the use of electronic attendance management system it is easy no time consuming process. For these purpose researches still developing different techniques. 2.2 Literature Review on Android  The main goal of developing attendance management application is to organize attendance details in easy way without consuming much time. Researchers used many techniques for providing these application. One of the process used by researches for making attendance during classes student send his photo to the faculty using email so that faculty ensures the presence of student in his class. Student can check his details by providing some information related to him for security purpose. For developing attendance management particularly Android is used because of some reasons:  Android operating system supports multi functioning. Android platform is open source and it is easily available to the consumer. Developing different application by using Android platform is easy. We can easily download applications from Google Android app. We can receive update notification automatically.  In the mobile market share Android devices occupies 85%. The main purpose of these application is providing and organizing attendance information in efficient way even the strength is more.  Fig 2.2.1 Bar chart representation on usage of Android application 2.3 Review on Existing Application In Earlier application is desktop related application, here user manually enter the information so that it consumes more time. In earlier application managing of attendance is become complex when it contain more number of people and it is not portable application. These system not support this application with heterogeneous systems. Instant information for both admin and students are not available and it contains less security to the data. Here sometimes information may be losses due to many reasons so we never guarantee the data present in a system. Earlier system not generating up to date reports so it may be difficult to the user for knowing there status information. 2.4 Limitations of Existing Application The main drawback of these earlier application is not portable. It cannot handle the data if strength is more. There is no existence of stronger security to the data present in a system. Earlier application is not supporting the usage of heterogeneous systems. In earlier application monitoring of information is most time consuming process and it is complex. It cannot schedule efficient data monitoring and information related to students and faculty. 2.5 Proposed changes in the new Application Drawback of portability is eliminated here. Mobile attendance management support all heterogeneous systems for functioning and this application handle attendance information even the strength is more, it is less time consuming process, it manages all the students and faculty information in easy way and it monitors the entire information in efficient way. It generates day to day and weekly, monthly reports. Less paper work is needed, because application access data from its data base directly, so it improves the performance speed of entire application. In proposed system computer operator control will be present so there is less chances of occurring errors, so work will be done in in time. Proposed system is user friendly, because both strong and retrieving of data is fast and Graphical User Interface is provides so user can easily interact with the Application. METHODOLOGY 3.1 Design Mobile Attendance is an Android application which is used for managing entire attendance details in efficient manner by using mobile devices.This application mainly contains three types of modules they are:  Admin Faculty Student          ADMIN:  Admin is having all the authority rights on both Faculty and Student. Initially the application will be started by login the admin with his user id and password. After login to the application the window will be appeared with Add Faculty and View Attendance buttons. Admin will add faculty by giving Faculty information like Faculty name, mobile number, email,  Subject, with Submit button.  After adding Faculty his user id and password will be sent to his mobile number and email so every time Faculty can login to the applications with these id and password. Next, When Admin click on View attendance button a window will be appeared with Year, Semester, Class, Brach boxes by selecting these boxes Admin can view total attendance information.  FACULTY:  Initially Faculty login to the application with his user id and password, after login the window will be appeared with View Attendance and View Reports buttons. If Faculty click on View Attendance, Other window will be appeared with Year, Semester, Class, Branch boxes, by selecting particular year, class, semester and branch he can view total student roll numbers belongs to particular class. Then, Faculty can choose particular student roll numbers then he can view the attendance information of that student. Next, when Faculty click on View reports, reports will be generated in 3 types they are end of the day reports and weekly reports and monthly reports. After clicking on View reports the window will appeared with Year, Semester, Class, Branch then select all the boxes then other window displayed all the students roll number belongs to that class then Faculty have to select particular roll number then window appeared with day report and weekly reports and monthly reports, so he can view the reports in Bar graph format. Faculty can retrieve the student data from database by using student roll number as a primary key.   STUDENT:  Student will be directly login to the application with their own user id and password having Submit and Register buttons. After click on Submit button another window will be appeared with View attendance and View reports buttons. When we click on View attendance he can retrieve only his attendance details with respect to date. When Student click on View reports he can view his day, week and monthly reports. He is having another button that is Present, when he click on these button the attendance is directly stored in database which is on Faculty side, The Student can give his attendance with in certain location which is fixed by Admin so student cannot perform any fault activities.  UML diagrams: UML stands for “Unified Modeling Language” it is used for describing about structural and behavioral patterns of a system.UML is used for visualizing and construction all the components of a system. It explains total working of a system. UML diagrams are basically classified into two types they are:  Structural Diagrams Behavioral Diagrams   Structural Diagrams: This diagrams represent static elements in a system, there are certain diagrams which comes under Structural are:  Class diagram Object diagram Component diagram Deployment diagram  Class Diagram: This diagrams are commonly used in UML, it consist class name, with their attributes and method names. Class diagrams represents what are the objects present in a system. Class diagrams contains associations, aggregation, and realization and collaboration relationships with other classes. Class diagrams contains some access specifiers with their operations and with their attributes. They are  + – #  Class diagram of these project contains three classes with names as admin, faculty, and student with their attributes and method names. Each class is having direct association with other classes for performing their jobs.                   Fig 3.1.1: showingadmin, faculty, student with their attributes and relations. Object Diagram: Object diagram contains set of objects with their suitable relationships, all those objects are static in nature. Object diagrams are similar to the class diagrams but the only difference is object diagrams represent practical view of a system. In representation the object can be represent with underline.  Component Diagram: In UML component diagrams explains about how the small components can be connected to form large components. Interfaces are used to connect one component with another means one component provide services to the other component. Component diagrams represents dependency relation between different components in a system. Component diagrams are mostly used in complex system which having many number of components. Deployment Diagrams: In UML Deployment diagrams shows the hardware components of a total system. It can be describe about what are the components present in a system with their suitable connections. In Deployment diagram nodes are represents with boxes and artifacts are represents in small rectangular box within a node. Generally these diagrams are used when the software is used in many system with same configurations. Behavioral Diagrams: Behavioral diagrams are mainly used to represents the behavior of a system, there are certain diagrams which comes under these session are:  Use case diagram Activity diagram Sequence diagram State chart diagram  Usecase Diagram: In UML use case diagrams represents communication among different elements in a system. In use case diagrams functionality’s nothing but use cases which represents in eclipse shape and actors are present in a system. Actors and use cases are related according to their roles in a system. From these diagram we can know who are the main participants in a system with their actions.  Activity Diagrams: In UML, activity diagrams represents the entire flow of a system in a graphical way. Activity diagram contains number of steps with arrows and shapes includes rounded rectangle indicates actions and diamond shapes represents decision and black circle indicated starting stage and double circle represents ending stages. Sequence Diagram: In UML, Sequence diagram explains behavior of a system, it describes how the object interacting with other objects with time lines. In Sequence diagram horizontal lines with arrows represent messages for communication and dashed line with arrow represents response messages, vertical dashed lines represents time lines. 3.2 Implementation Home Screen: Initial step is to unlock the home screen of android phone and then click on the icon show in below figure3.2.1. Fig 3.2.1: Home Screen  Selection Screen: Now we have to select our application from home screen.  Fig 3.2.2: Selection screen  Application Screen: The next step is to open application screen.

Methodology Tools and Technologies Used  JAVA SE DEVELOPMENT KIT (JDK) ANDROID SDK SQL LITE ANDROID STUDIO  JDK The Java Development Kit (JDK) is an execution of both of the Java SE, Java EE or Java ME stages expel by Oracle Corporation as a parallel item went for Java designers on Solaris, Linux, Mac OS X or Windows. The JDK incorporates a private JVM and a couple of different assets to complete the formula to a Java Application. Since the presentation of the Java stage, it has been by a wide margin the most generally utilized Software Development Kit (SDK). A Java Development Kit (JDK) is a project improvement environment for composing Java applets and applications. It comprises of a runtime situation that “sits on top” of the working framework layer and also the apparatuses and programming that engineers need to assemble, investigate, and run applets and applications written in the Java language. Android SDK  Android is a working framework taking into account the Linux piece, and composed principally for touchscreen cell phones, for example, cell phones and tablet PCs. At first grew by Android, Inc., which Google supported fiscally and later purchased in 2005, Android was disclosed in 2007 alongside the establishing of the Alliance consortium of equipment, programming, and telecom organizations. The main hardware platform for Android is the 32-bit ARMv7 construction modeling. The Android-x86 undertaking gives backing to the x86 structural engineering, and Google TV utilizes a unique x86 adaptation of Android. In 2012, Intel processors started to show up on more standard Android stages, for example, telephones. In 2013, Free scale declared backing for Android on its i.MX processor, particularly the i.MX5X and i.MX6X arrangement. SQLite SQLite is a relational database administration framework contained in a C programming library. Rather than other database administration frameworks, SQLite is not a different procedure that is gotten to from the customer application, however an essential piece of it SQLite is ACID-consistent and executes the vast majority of the SQL standard, utilizing a rapidly and pitifully wrote SQL grammar that does not ensure the area uprightness. SQLite is a prevalent decision as inserted database for neighborhood/customer stockpiling in application programming, for example, web programs. It is ostensibly the most generally sent database motor, as it is utilized today by a few far reaching programs, working frameworks, and implanted frameworks, among others. SQLite has numerous ties to programming languages. The source code for SQLite is in the general public area.            "

116,http://1000projects.org/travel-planner-android-application.html,travel planner android application.," In this busy life, we find very little time for recreation or vacation. Nowadays more and more people would like to travel, explore and enjoy. A travel planning approach has recently been focus of interest for enhancing performance. Most traveler need to plan prior their traveling for energy saving and visiting maximum places of interest within the specific travel time. Existing System There are different applications available to plan your trip or vacation that includes booking flights, railway reservation, hotel bookings etc. This become easier as the users can check the availability of flights; rooms etc with just a click.travel websites are making impacting entry into the world of tourism. Past few years have seen a revolutionary rise in such websites. Some of the websites running successfully are Thomas Cook, TripAdvisor, MakeMyTrip and Trivago.           Disadvantages of Existing System:  Low cost booking sites offer discounts with conditions. User need to specify details foe every booking like flights, hotel rooms, restaurants etc. Many websites, after displaying the list will redirect to other websites pages. No option for specifying total vacation budget. No proper sync between different categories like rooms maybe available but no availability of flights.  Proposed System An application for travel that can take the user’s query and display various travel plans according to the query. User’s query includes source-destination, travel budget, and duration. The query is interpreted and the application displays various travel plans that are based on user’s query. The selected travel plan can be further customized. The proposed system is a web based application and maintains a centralized repository of all related information. Advantages:  The Application will understand and interpret the query. The budget allotted to various categories can also be prioritized i.e. prioritizing travel over food. Selected travel plans can be customized. Additional information about the destination, related images and videos, reviews is also available.   Various services are available in a single application like whether, alerts etc.  System Scope Thus this application will help the users in planning the vacation by just specifying query. The tour operators business encompasses a large range of offerings. You can cater to inbound or outbound tour services like travel booking, hotel . The scope of tour operators business is vast; however you must do a cost benefit analysis before actually deciding what to offer in a tourism based website            "

This android app helps the main event co-originator/ manager to schedule tasks and communicate with them effectively. The event manager can make use of internet for communication and notifying alerts about particular tasks or work schedule to key volunteers of the events so that more people can access the relevant information with ease. The interested candidates can register themselves online. The list of registered candidates is directly sent to that concerned event coordinator and list of shortlisted candidates is then updated and they are notified by an e-mail as well as an SMS alert.           This provides positive publicity before an event. It also enables people all over the college to plan and promote any event efficiently.

It is about storing the information or details of each individual student studying in their respective departments, which displays the name of the student, phone number(s) of the each individual student. This will be a very useful concept as it will give the college management or the department head to know the complete information of the student studying in that department and the management of the college can even update parents of the student by reaching them through the phone or by sending them the message. By this they can have the interaction with the parents directly. The management of the college can notify the students and parents by sending the attendance percentage, marks in the internals, greetings during festivals, etc. This helps the parents to know about their child. This project is based on the database in which we can store and retrieve all the information regarding students and what all we require.

120,http://1000projects.org/message-reader-android-application.html,message reader android application.," The scope of the Message Reader Android Application is to make you listen to your messages whenever you feel like, while keeping your hands and eyes free for other things. It reads the text messages. Thus it might be user friendly and very much useful/helpful to the person using it. In the present days it is becoming highly impossible to find any person without a mobile. So, the increases in demand for mobiles are high and people are expecting new technologies in mobiles. Android came up with a solution to meet the demand for latest technology of mobiles. Android was founded in Palo Alto, California, United States in October 2003 by Andy Rubin (co-founder of Danger). Android is a Linux-based operating system for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers. It is developed by the open handset alliance, led by Google and other companies. Android has a large community of developers writing applications that extend the functionality of the devices. So it would be safe to say that nearly every mobile phone sold-out in the past decade has SMS capabilities. So, here we are to introduce you an all new messaging technology called ‘MESSAGE READER’ a quick and latest way of messaging. ‘MESSAGE READER’, the name itself suggests a new era to our regular chats via messaging. In our day to day lives we do a lot of messaging with our friends and people we know. By installing message reader application in our android we can make this process easier and quicker. This application is based on the change of format of received message. When a sender sends a message the receiver will receive a message in audio format. Thus a new version for our regular chat is here. The receiver can reply via text quickly. By introducing this application in an android market we can improve the quality of messaging.           Existing system with limitations: The present messaging system includes the manual opening and going through the message received by the receiver whenever he/she receives a message. Because of this the receiver cannot be hands-free due to the received message. The receiver may not have the knowledge of the message received even without having glimpse at it. Data Flow diagram Context level Data Flow diagram Top level Proposed system with features:  The limitations of the regular sms system we already know that is the user should open the sms and he should read and there is no option called listening sms as voice so it is very difficult when the user is in some other busy work that is he may not be able to read sms when sms came. So we proposed one application that is whenever the sms came to mobile it will give some messaging box with some quick options that is go to inbox, read sms and reply. So like in existing system the user need not to go through the more options for reading sms. He simply do any operation on sms box quickly. The text message will be handled within Message Reader will only intercept the new message in order to be able to speak it to you, but your proper installed application. If you have Message Reader activated, and one message arrives to your phone, the process will be the following one:  Message Reader detects the new message using a broadcast receiver (until this moment the app has not been wasting battery) Starts a background service with the TTS system, when all the work is done, Message Reader will start to speak the message.  While the Message Reader is active, your phone OS (Android) saves your new messages and usually generates a new notification and your Message Reader app will alert you. For example, I have a SMS ‘X’ and after Message Reader reads the message, I can also manually read the SMS in SMS ‘X’. The main characteristics are:  The application reads all SMS text messages by voice, the moment you get them. It reads the contact name from your address phone book instead of the phone number. Abbreviations management (add / edit / delete your own abbreviations). Message Reader will not waste phone battery. Message Reader will be active only when the SMS arrives. Language settings are automatically detected from phone location and language configuration.  Activity diagram Class Diagram Collaboration Diagram Sequence Diagram Use case Diagram Software Requirement Specification   Front End : Java Back End : Sqlite Operating System : Windows-xp Frame Work : Android   Problem Definition: Now a days the times have changed ,the technologies have changed and so as the expectation of the people have changed .Now a day’s everyone want the best and the latest applications in their phone .So here we are to present them with their latest requirements in the messaging applications of their phone i.e. our software MESSAGE READER. In the current days the messaging software is only advanced in the iphone and nokia c6. Only in these two mobiles the advanced features i.e. voice recognition technologies have been introduced in these phones .As the expectation of the people to have the latest apps in their own mobiles at the lowest cost possible has been increasing day by day. This software or operating system as like IPHONE have the capability to convert the text message into audio format and audio recorded message into a text format .The android phones now a days have a inbuilt feature of converting the audio recorded message into text format but not the reverse process. So, here we are to develop the application to fulfill this desire of the people of getting such new features in their regular messaging by using our application i.e. “MESSAGE READER”. Proposed Solution: This application proposes a new era in our regular chat applications via messaging. We now a day’s do loads of messaging with our friends and other known people .By installation of “MESSAGE READER” software in our android phone we can make this process more easier and quicker . This application is based on the change of format of the incoming message .As a sender sends a message the receiver would get is as a popup which is a advanced feature provided by our software because in our routine android phones the messages would be shown as an notification. In that popup, there will be three options namely AUDIO, TEXT and REPLY. We all know what happens when we click on text and reply option i.e. our current existing system of messaging .If we go audio option then our text would be converted to audio format by the device and we can hear the text message as speech format. Thus, a new version or vision to our regular chats is here. CONCLUSION: Finally it is a quick and latest way of messaging application which will allow the user to listen the text message as in the voice format by using the text to speech facility in the android. And also it will allow all the existed features in general messaging system in a color full way. Output Screens: Initially when the emulator is started i.e. when we run the program.  The popup, when a new message arrives.  When the audio option is selected the speech is heard in this screen.  When we go to the reply option.  The inbox of the receiver.  The initial screen of the sender and  when the sender selects the messaging option.  When the  sender is sending the message to the receiver .             "
121,http://1000projects.org/give-away-application-android-application.html,give away application android application.," Here are the required Donors and Receivers Android Application specifications: This is Donors and Receivers Android based Application, Its not a static app, It is a server based app. Two API s have to be used. 1. Facebook 2. Google Maps Better understanding:  Just like any other shopping site . The only difference is. , the products will be free of cost.. donors log in to donate things. Receivers log in to receive things free of cost. (Sellers-buyers, Donors-receivers). Some part of the Donors and Receivers project is already done. In the completed part , Facebook API is already partially used by using  Facebook SDK.  (Any user logs in to the app only through Facebook). Google maps API is yet to be incorporated,           Basic outline of the application is specified below:  After signing up we come across two scenarios first the user looking forward to donate something and second the user looking to receive something. In the first case of the user being a donor, we wish to provide him with categories or departments like electronics, furniture e.t.c. where he selects the particular category and in that category moves further down to products like washing machines, dish washers e.t.c and here if he does not find a match for his product add his own product name.      Example:   Suppose a donor wishes to put a dvd player for give away  He logs in as a donor. Looks for the category electronics and selects it. Now in the electronics section looks for the product dvd player and suppose the products already being displayed are refrigerator, washing machine, television e.t.c. but does not find a dvd player, we give him the option of adding his own product so that he adds dvd player as a new product to the existing list and puts his item on display.   The donor should be given an option “add a new category” if he wish to donate an item which is not present in the already existing list. After a donor had added the new category, from then, the newly added category should be visible to the users who log in as receivers also. In the second case where the user is a receiver looking for items we would like to give him the same option of browsing through the various categories (example. a user looking for a vacuum cleaner would search in the HOME APPLIANCES section) then look for vacuum cleaners by typing the keyword vacuum cleaner in the search bar provided and select the product vacuum cleaner. Then he would have a list of all vacuum cleaners available for give away. Now the receiver would like to set filters like new added products or the products located within a particular distance or brand new / used products which would narrow his search to few items. Then the user would select the one he wishes to have.   Home appliances  Vacuum cleaners Oven Fridge Ac Fans   Furniture:  Tables Chairs Cots Beds Coffee Maker Toaster Sofa Pillows Blankets Curtains   Kitchenware  Cooking Utensils Cutlery   Electronics  Music system DVD player TV Laptops Clothes   Stationary:  Books   Utilities:  Organizer Laundry basket Wardrobe Shoe rack Bicycles Bed lamp Ladders Tool kit Pet accessories Gardening accessories Bags Travel bags  The modifications and further extension requirements are specified below:  Log in and Logout functionality is not working properly. When clicked on “Log in with face book” button, it is again displaying the same page which have the button “Log in with face book”. ( My observation: This is happening when face book app is installed on my device. If I disable or uninstall the facebook app on my device then the giveaway app is allowing me to login properly)   “Back” button should be added in every page to navigate to the previous page, Instead now when I m using the back button of my device, the app is getting closed.   Backround image is too dominant . The categories cannot be seen clearly. If possible , Background image may be changed.   As far as here, I wasn’t able to see if the receiver who set up the suitable filters can see the items uploaded by the donors because I cant see what’s happening after clicking “confirm donation” . So as on whole I am unable to check anything about the aspects with which the database is concerned.    DONATE:  It is asking for item location while trying to donate. ( intended to determine the location automatically using fb and google maps api) ( this requirement may be neglected but it will be better if this text box is validated atleast to make sure that the donor is giving the appropriate city name .It is expected not take invalid inputs like 1234 for the city name. So while donor is typing the city name , providing drop down city names suggestions list will be appropriate.)   Mandatory specification: Donor should provide a pickup location where the receiver has to come to pick the particular item. Not just the city name. should be precise and exact like what it looks like in google maps. so that the receiver will be able to locate it in google maps. So the location should be properly validated.. While the donor is typing the pickup location that text box may be same as that in the google maps which shows the drop down suggestions of the exact location). Here is where we have to prove that google maps API is used.   Item description (and tags) has to be added while adding a new item, so that the same will be displayed to the receivers also and the item will appear in receiver’s search results in relation to the search key words used by the receiver and the corresponding tags provided by the donor.   When clicked on “confirm donation” button without uploading any picture… app is accessing camera. Donor should be given an option to upload anything without any picture also.   After taking a picture , if I immediately click on the “confirm donation “ button, then UNFORUNATELY GIVE AWAY HUB HAS STOPPED. ( My guess: This may be because, it is taking time to complete the uploading process of the picture which we had just clicked. So for uploading the picture, a progress bar should be added. So the user will know when to click the “confirm donation” after the uploading is completely done.   (Modify if possible and time permits) Add new item can be seen only in the main category list. But, under each category, donor should be given an option to add a new item… For example, as of now, under the category of stationery only “books” is present,, if he wish to donate a compass kit which also falls under stationery, then he will go to “add a new item” and add compass kit as new variant,, from then even the receivers will be able to see the “compass kit” along with “books” under the “stationery” category.   RECEIVE :  Recent, Distance, New products are appearing as buttons (but intended to be as check boxes which will allow the receiver to set more than one filter at a time. With present format of buttons the receiver will not be able to set more than one filter) ( Proper working of filters is mandatory specification)   After loading the results also, its showing a text “searching for books” . Instead “Results for books” may be appropriate .   When searched for books to receive, I can see some buttons like “receive item form hyd” “Receive item from mumbai”. The locations need to be appeared directly in such a way. When the receiver search for a particular item he will set the filter distance from his city ( receiver’s location should be determined from his facebook location ), the results within the desired proximity should be loaded ( i..e as per the pickup location provided by the sender).   Receiver should be shown the name of the donor ( facebook profile name) of the particular product when he is reviewing the product. For each item the receiver is viewing, he should be shown the following specifications of the particular product : Item description, Picture, donor’s facebook profile name, pickup location .   When a receiver is willing to receive a product, the receiver should be asked “Notify Donor through facebook”. Then the facebook notification should be sent to the donor that a particular receiver is willing to receive his product also mentioning the profile of the receiver. So, now the sender contacts the desired receiver through facebook for possible time to pickup at the pickup location as mentioned earlier. (Facebook API comes into play again).              "

Mobiles have become important part of our lives. Most of us store important information in our mobile phones. It is crucial that we keep our mobile phones safe against theft and phones being misplaced by the phone user.  Project components resolution and individual contribution outline:           The components that are used in this application are  Clock Contacts GPS Camera Gmail Data Base  The user has to provide the application with the time at which the check has to be performed. And also the user has to provide the emergency contact number and email address to which the data has to be sent. It should give the user few options like GPS, front camera image capture, back camera image capture so as to perform these tasks and send the data to the given contact number and email address. The application does a routine check whether the phone is being used according to the given scheduled time. If the phone has not been used in the scheduled time, then the application captures image with the camera and retrieves the GPS location. Then it sends the picture and the location to one of the selected contact number through text message and to the selected email address. This application can be enabled and disabled because the phones might not be used in certain situations like while studying, during sleep, etc., One of us will be coding the part where a routine check is being performed and Sending the retrieved image and GPS through text message. Other one of us will be coding the part where a number is selected, camera captures the image automatically and retrieving the GPS location. Project test plan: Project test plan includes unit testing and system integrated testing. Unit Testing: Unit testing has to be done for each of the modules. Smaller modules may be individual source codes, individual methods and fragments of codes. This is also called as white box testing. We would like to perform unit testing with the individual components like clock, contacts, GPS, Camera. And also the versions with which this application will be compatible with. Integrated Testing: After all the modules are created, integrated testing is to be performed. This testing is performed after unit testing. This testing takes all the modules on which unit testing has been performed and groups them into larger modules to perform integrated testing. This is also called as black box testing.            "

124,http://1000projects.org/kisan-seva-android-application.html,kisan seva android application.," Overview: This application focuses on helping farmers. It’s purpose is to give profits to farmers. The basic idea of this application is online auction. It allows farmers to sell their crops at best price. Existing Systems: Every time farmers have to sell their crops at market to authorized distributors for fixed prices set by market management which is loss for them (this system works manually). Online systems:- There are some systems through which farmers can sell their crops online like ’24myntra’ but farmers not able to get proper profits with this system.           Limitations:  Farmers have to sell their crops at fixed prices . Farmers have to travel and sell their crops on regular basis by spending their money. Farmers have to sell their crops only to authorized distributors. Illiterate farmers cannot use present existing online systems.  Proposed System:  The current application can be accessed by two types of users(buyers and sellers). As farmer is illiterate, he accesses this application with the help of another trusted party. Buyers can demand their desired crops using this application. Buyers can submit their feedback regarding the crops which they won in auction. Through this application advertisement of fertilizers and pesticides can be done by third party.Information about schemes given by government for farmers can be uploaded in this application. Working: It takes the information regarding the crop from seller which is advertised and auctioned by third party. The information regarding the crops are visible to users who want to buy the crops. Generally auction happens for certain period of time.After the auction the buyer who is ready to pay highest price for particular crop gets the crop.For the purpose of conducting auction third party will be benefited. Advantages:  By using this system farmers can get more profit compared to manually existing systems. Illiterate farmers can easily use this system with the help of trusted third party. Farmers need not go to market for selling their crops . There are no fixed prices for crops instead farmers can set their own reasonable prices. Based on reviews given by buyers,sellers can produce the crops. Farmers can enjoy the government schemes through these application  Conclusion: Through this application farmers can get acceptable prices for their crops.            "

Our intention is to establish a good communication between Student Mentor and parent. In this new era of Science and Technology, computer is one of the most important components in our life. Works can be done in a better way by the help of computer.            We have seen over the years that the process of manual attendance is being carried out across almost all educational institutions. The process is not only time consuming but also sometimes yield inefficient results in the false marking and calculation of attendance. We need not maintain pen and paper based attendance registers. Following this thought, we have proposed a PARENT COMMUNICATION REGISTER (PCR) APP by which we notify parents via SMS OR a call Notification system which is implemented on Android mobile application. This Android application will give the students attendance information and SMS notification feature whereby every parent will be periodically notified regarding his/her child attendance Our system primarily focuses on building an efficient and user friendly Android mobile application. The application will be installed on the Mentor phone which runs android OS. It intends to provide an interface to the professor who will require a user id and password to carry out the task. Apart from that, the application would support strong user authentication and quick transmission of data.  Modules:  Admin    Faculty  Admin: In Admin module, we design the administrator activities like viewing the attendance related to students marked by all the faculty. Hisprivileges can be seen at the use case diagram.

130,http://1000projects.org/sketch-yourself-android-application.html,sketch yourself android application.," Project Name: ”Sketch Yourself” an application for Android device users. The main aim of the application is to generate a pencil based sketch out of the image supplied as input. Project Description:  “Sketch yourself” – an application specially designed for ‘Art-lovers’, now can have a quick pencil-sketch of their own in minutes, and others they are willing to make of.   The application is expected to be an easy-to-use Sketch-drawing tool which uses an image as input and fetches different types of Pencil-Sketches as output. Hence providing users with choices for selection.   Includes an Image-gallery, which supports Image Selection from wide range of Images available on memory.   Finally, helps in saving the new sketched Image to the memory, assigning a user-defined name.  Scope of the Project:            Users of the Application are able to get different types of pencil sketches on their finger-tip. No need of sitting for hours in the Artist-queue to get you sketched.   Makes use of some Image-processing Algorithms for building a sketch. Hence an exposure to learn something new.   Talking about the technology: o   Android being the latest Operating System for cellular phones now-a-days, there arises a need to develop an application for Android users. Hence, making user more comfortable. o   One of the best advantage in using Android, is that it is Open source, providing the same API’s for both native and third-party users. And the next best advantage is that Android is not a proprietary version and hence attracts large volume of Developers. Planning: Project-definition: “Sketch Yourself” aims to be an application for android device users, which generates a beautiful pencil-sketch out of any image inputted to the application. The main feature of the application is to generate a pencil-based sketch created by artists. The features of the system include:   Providing the user with Image-gallery interface to choose image. Generating Sketch out of user’s selected image. Finally, saving it on the phone.  Technically speaking, the project aims at creating the sketch with the help of certain Image processing algorithms like Gray-scale, Invert, Blur, etc. Let’s have an exact look at what the system should do:  Preliminary Investigation  Preliminary investigation talks about the first look on what the system aims to do. The main task of the system is to produce pencil-sketch. Now, the question is how to achieve it? Having surfed the Internet and referred different books on Image processing, got an initial idea of what should ideally be done. One of the Algorithms for generating pencil-sketch out of an image is discussed below. Let’s have a look at the pseudo-code along with an example: Brief on Project Development Methodology: In this application to be developed, I would prefer to use a combination of “Application Proto-typing Methodology” and “Object-orineted Methodology”, as we need to successively develop and test algorithm, its exactness and its quality and choose the preferred one and make changes as required. Application Proto-type Methodology:  The term ‘Proto-type’ refers to the working model of an information system application.   A proto-type may be a diagram, a business process or even a system placed into production.   Steps involved in Proto-typing method:  Identify Proto-type Agree to plan Create Proto-type Review Proto-type     Proto-type is a live, working application.   Proto-types evolve through an iterative process.   Proto-type helps in clarifying user requirements and also to verify feasibility of the application.   Requirement Specification:  ‘Sketch Yourself’ will be designed to work with the android based mobile phones.    The application will have Straightforward and user-friendly interface.   It will allow viewing images both from the phone as well as the memory-card.   Any image selected by the user is processed to get a beautiful sketch of pencil. One such example is shown below:   Allows the user to choose from different variations of sketches processed by the application.   The one chosen by the user can be saved back on memory as a new Image.   The output file will be saved with the new name given by the user.    System Design Architectural  Activity Diagram   The above activity diagram depicts the overall activities of the system i.e, it includes step-by-step procedure.  Use-cases  Use-cases are interactive diagrams which reflect the communication of user with the system. Major use-cases of the system are as follows:  Select Image-file Use-case           This use-case allows the user to choose a specific Image-file for input to the application. Here, a validation should be performed for supporting only specific image-formats as inputs. Produce Sketch Use-case           This use-case allows the user to produce sketch using some image-processing algorithms on image. It also includes resizing the image, converting into Bitmaps, etc. Save the Sketch Use-case           Finaly, when the sketch is available to the user. He needs to provide the file-name for the output image file and save it to desired location on the memory card.  Validate an Image File Use-case This use-case enables the system to check whether the selected file is an image or not. It also confirms whether the file is in specific image format supported by the application. Views the Image File Use-case After the user selects a particular image-file and the the file is also validated, this use-case enables to view the image to the user. Re-size Image Use-case This use-case enbles the application to resize the image, if it exceeds specific limits, inorder to ease the faster execution of the algorithm used. Sharpen Image Use-case This use-case allows the user to sharpen the image, if the user requires. Convert to Bitmap Use-case This use-case enables the application to convert the Image inputted to Bitmap format, so that we can process the algorithm which uses Bitmap format. Process the Algorithm Use-case This use-case allows the most important part of the application i.e. to apply algorithm on the Bitmap image and produce the sketch.  Provide desired file-name Use-case The above use-case enables the user to enter the file-name he wishes to provide for the output file. Choose Location Use-case This use-case enables the user to show the location where the sketch-image file should be stored. User-Manual “Sketch yourself” is an android application which is helpful to people who are art-lovers and wish to design their own pencil-sketch from the image in minutes. We may explain the procedure in detail as below.  First Step This document explains you(users) with how the software works. Let us say you have your android device. You need to open the application by selecting it from the menu as I have pointed out. Here, the user needs to open the application by clicking on the application icon from the menu-window. Second Step As we click on the application icon in the previous step, next we get the home-page of the application. Home-page is designed in such a way that it shows what we would receive as output from the input given. A very self-explanatory image shown. Here, At the home-page of the application, the user needs to press the “Open File” button, as I have pointed. Third Step: As we click the open file button i.e , the control of the application is transferred to the Gallery application where user needs to select an image and click on it to select. By click we mean – finger touch. Here, scrolling is facilitated. So the user can scroll for more images down in the gallery. Fourth Step As the user selects a particular image, the above screen appears so as to show the user, the image he has selected. Here, the user needs to press any of the two buttons available. The first button “Pencil Sketch” is to create a pencil based sketch while the other button “Black & White Sketch” is to create a black-white sketch of the given inputted image. Fifth Step On selecting the first button “Pencil-sketch”, we get this output. Here, we need to provide the name of the sketch inorder to save the file to the device and press the save button. Final step is user can exit the application by pressing the “Exit App..” button. Allows the user to save the sketch.. Allows the user to exit the application., Fifth Step-b Here, when the user selects the second option of “Black and White Sketch” , he gets the above image as output. Hence, he can save the file to the device. Allows the user to exit the application., Allows the user to save the sketch.. Future Enhancements: The project produces two different types of sketches a user can have for his image. Next, we can have a camera running directly from the application itself to facilitate user have a sketch of the instant image clicked. Another future enhancement I would like to see in my project is to share the image to social-networking sites like facebook, twitter, etc.            "

People usually carry few necessities with them, and we cannot separate mobile phones from these. For one or another reason, it sometime happens that people misplace or lose the thing, and one cannot easily afford losing the thing like mobile. People always want the mobile to be with them.            Purpose behind developing the iLocate is to provide its user to track their lost or misplaced mobile. Misplaced mobile A simple text message from a friend’s mobile will make users mobile to ring (even if it is on Silent mode) if phone is misplaced within reachable range. Lost mobile Sometimes user loses his mobile and he/she may not able to locate it through making it ‘ringing’ because mobile may not be within a reachable range. At those times application can serve the user by following ways:  A simple text message from friend’s mobile will help user to receive his phone’s GPS location information on friend’s mobile as a URL. By clicking or opening this link user will be able to see the current location of his/her mobile on Google Map. If SIM change takes place on user’s mobile, iLocate will notify about this SIM change activity by sending text messages to friend’s mobile numbers. Following are terms used throughout this documentation: Pass code Pass code is a keyword that user of application sets when he uses the application for the first time. This code is then used by user for subsequent login to the application. User can’t access application without having pass code. User may change pass code any time.  Whitelist White list is a list of mobile numbers of user’s friends. User may add to, remove from or change numbers defined in this list. Once user adds a number to this list, this number is recognized as a Trusted Number by iLocate, and user of this number is a Trusted User. This means that only a trusted user can send codewords from his/her trusted mobile so that application can prevent unwanted users from misusing the features of application. Friends A friend is a trusted user whose number exists as an entry in white list. Friend and trusted user are names that may be used interchangeably. Codewords A codeword is a keyword that user has defined for taking a desired action when his/her mobile receives that codeword to his/her mobile, from a trusted number. iLocate has currently two kind of codewords.  GPS Codeword: A GPS codeword is a keyword that user has defined within iLocate. When a trusted user sends this codewords from his/her trusted mobile to user’s number as a text message, application recognizes it and generates a link that can help user to view his/her location on Google Map. This link is sent back to trusted user’s mobile so that he/she can locate user’s mobile on Map.   Ringer Codeword: A Ringer codeword is another keyword that user has defined within application. When user’s loses his/her mobile within a reachable range but due to the current profile on the mobile he/she may not be able to locate mobile, at these times a friend may help user by sending a simple text messages (we call it Ringer codeword) that will make user’s mobile ringing.  These codewords are configurable by user of application once he/she is logged in. SIM change notification receiver SIM change notification receiver is another list of mobile numbers of user’s friends. User may add to, remove from and change numbers defined in this list. Once user adds a number to this list, application notifies on these numbers by sending text messages when SIM change takes place on user’s mobile. Numbers in this list are also termed as Trusted Numbers. Implementation:  Setting application pass-code at first use Asking pass-code to enter System Application prompts when user selects small pass-code Application’s main user interface Codeword setups- to set/modify codewords Whitelist- list of trusted user numbers SIM change setup- to add/update SIM change notification receiver Prompts when user leaves pass-code setup activity Error message on setting invalid pass-code Prompts when any updates are made Alerts when user leaves any activity without saving details Received message on friend’s mobile when he sends codeword to get for user’s location information User’s location is shown on the map when friend clicks on the link sent as a message through iLocate Defined friends receives notification as a text message when user’s mobile’s SIM is changed  Tools and Technologies  + Software: Android Platform v2.1 and later Development tools: Android SDK:     includes all power features of java adding to it more specific APIs for android development.

User Manual Introduction This application will help an Android user to track the lost or misplaced mobile. If user misplaces a mobile which is currently in silent/vibrate mode, he may change the phone mode to ‘ringing’ by using another mobile with facility of sending text message. Also if user loses mobile he may find current GPS location of his mobile through another mobile. It notifies mobile user on SIM change via text message on another predefined mobile. This application also restricts unauthenticated change in App-Settings by using password protection. Users of this guide This User manual is intended to be used by user’s of iLocate application on the android mobile having Android platform version 2.2 or later. It provides a complete set of instructions for an iLocate user to demonstrate each individual feature of iLocate user. Functional Description iLocate comes with the set of features to locate your lost or misplaced android mobile. User may find his mobile by turning off the silent mode by sending simple code as a text message to make his mobile ring. User may also locate his device on map by requesting the mobile’s current location through sending a simple preconfigured code as text message from another trusted device to user’s mobile. In response user will get a link as a text message on a trusted device which will show user’s mobile’s current location on map. User can choose specific numbers to receive the command from by maintaining a list called – ‘Whitelist’. User will receive notifications on preconfigured trusted mobile numbers; about any SIM change activity on user’s mobile by configuring the SIM change setup. Instruction Sections Getting stated (User may get the application by visiting <x.com>/iLocate). Installation may take time depending on your device and data connection. Once you are done with installation you are ready to GO. First use After installation you can run the application by going in to main menu and launch the application by clicking iLocate icon as shown in Figure 1.1. Application will prompt the password (Figure 1.2) to be used for login. This is asked only once when you first time or when password is not set. After setting the password you will be redirected to pass through activity (Figure 1.3). Enter the password you set here and click Ok. On correct password entry you will get the main interface of iLocate (Figure 1.4). Defining Whitelist White list is a list of numbers which are allowed to send the codewords on user’s mobile. We will refer them as Trusted Users or Whitelist. To define or update Whitelist, Go to Whitelist from main menu (Figure 2.1). You may add up to 5 contacts. Click on Update after you are done. Now iLocate will recognize these numbers as trusted ones and will allow to command user’s device. Configuring the commands Go to Codeword setup from main menu. Define Ringer codeword and GPS codeword. Ringer codeword will cause user’s device to switch to General profile and make it Ring for some time, upon receiving Ringer codeword. GPS codeword will cause user’s mobile to generate a link defining its current location and cause it send it to the trusted user’s mobile as a text message. SIM change setup This feature allows you to define mobile numbers which will receive notification if SIM change takes place on iLocate user’s mobile. To define or modify your SIM change notification receiver’s mobile number, go to SIM change setup (figure 2.3) from main menu. You are allowed to enter up to 2 mobile numbers. iLocate will notify these defined notification receiver about any SIM change on user’s mobile via a Text message. Changing application pass code Once you are logged in, you can change your password. To change password, go to Application settings from main menu, simply replace password with new one. You must select password that is at least 4 characters long. Future Enhancement: We have included very basic features that required for application to work. Some advancement in futures may possible for better features and better user experience. Dynamic entries for contacts & fetching contacts from mobile instead of manual typing: This version of iLocate has fixed number of allowable contact numbers for White list and SIM change list. Advance controls may be used to add or remove text fields as per user’s need. Also application may allow user to fetch contact from People list itself and selecting accordingly. Connecting using internet Application may be extended to make a use of internet to allow the device to be located through another device by trusted users (already registered with application) and to track movements of user’s device.

User need to give the details of source and destination. Accordingly it will display the details of the bus number which is going in that route. It is a time saving application to user. User can easily get the information of the bus number of a particular route. In this way a user will be free of confusion about the buses. It will also be very helpful for those people who are new to the city.             KEY FUNTIONALITY: In the cities, especially  in India buses are major form of transportation.  So by this app we can get the information required for reaching to the desired destination. We select  the source and destination  and after  pressing  the  submit  button we get the  bus   number   of the  bus  we have to travel  . Thus this application has its importance in the city travelling.  Introduction Existing system: There are some bus route finders and bus number finding  systems in the internet these days But these require  internet  connectivity for the working of the application. This is somewhat money consuming. Also if the net is slow the process is also slow. And  if the net  connectivityis weak  then the process of finding the busses will also be difficult. To overcome the above problems we have developed our particular   project which will work without internet.  Proposed System: CityBusManagement applicationthat wehave developedwill workwithout internet connectivity. This is the  major advantage  thisparticular applicationwe have developed our  project t has  a database of  its own which makes it independent of  internet,and  it displays the bus numbers  on its own.  This makes finding  of the  bus numbers easy, fast and  efficient .

134,http://1000projects.org/mobile-theft-monitoring-android-application.html,mobile theft monitoring android application.," The objective of this project is to create an android application “Mobile theft monitoring” where we are able to find our lost phone easily. Sometimes we accidently tend to replace our phone somewhere and we end up searching for it. Yet sometimes we are lucky to get our phones back but sometimes we never get it back. Hence to avoid such situations and keeping the recent demand and the greed for phones in mind we have decided to develop this application “mobile theft monitoring”.            This application gets activated as soon as the person who has stolen the phone changes the sim and switches on the phone. The user will not know that an automatic message is being sent to the predefined number. This message will contain the sim details as well as the location details. This information will be sent as a message to the destined number till the application is uninstalled in the mobile. This will be like a torture to the user and makes it easy to find the location of the phone and track the user. The location of the device is found using GPS and the details are sent to the predefined number in the form of a message as soon as the user changes the sim and switches on the phone . The application also consists of the setting of the number to which the message regarding the sim and the location details are to be sent. In this application all the operations are done in the background using the concept called “service”. Thus “mobile theft monitoring” is a useful application which helps us to track and find the device in an effective manner. INTRODUCTION Nowadays since the usage of phones has increased ,the demand for  creative and new applications has also increased . The security of mobile phones play an important   role hence we decided to create a project   called “mobile theft  monitoring”.  PROJECT ANALYSIS It is an appication where it helps the user to find out where the device is if it is stolen.when the person steals the phone and changes the sim an  automatic  message which displayes the location of the device ,sim number,phone number, imsi number  will be sent  to a number  which  we specify in the settings . thus the device that has been stolan will be found easily . In our appication we have the facility to specify the num to which a msg about the location. The application also consists of the setting of the number to which the message regarding the sim and the location details are to be sent . In this application all the operation are done in the background using the concept called “service”. A special feature of this application is that we have provided a long press for the specification of the  broadcast reciever number in the application itself which the user will not know. The screen that will be displayed to him SCOPE: The scope of this project is that we will be able to get our device back and we will get the sim details even if the person has changed the sim . In addition to that we will also get the phone number and the location  details which makes the theft monitoring action an easy task. The objective is to design a simple, intuitive interface with limited screen estate for the monitoring of the theft action. FEATURES: The main feature of this project is that this application does not need any special indication or operation, the sim and location details are automatically sent as a message to the destined number as soon as the user changes the sim and switches on the phone . Another feature of this project is that we have the option to put the sim in white list , so that it traces only if a new sim has been inserted by another person and not our permanent number. Usually when a device is lost we have applications where only the location of the phone is sent to another phone but in our project the SIM details and the location details are sent to the destined number making the tracking process a less tedious job. Our project works in such a way that the user will not be knowing that the sim and the location details is being sent as a message to a specified number as soon as he changes the sim switches on the phone. Since nowadays the craze and the greed for phones has increased it is becoming highly difficult to protect and safeguard our devices Hence we have proposed this project in such away to get our devices back even if it gets stolen. Existing system with limitations: In the existing phones we only have the facility where the location of the device is tracked and is sent back to the user. In such cases if the user has lost his phone and the person who has taken the device changes the sim and replaces it with another sim then the tracking of location will be of no use since the sim has been replaced with another sim . and even if ther is a provision of sending the location of the device to another android phone ,the information is not enough to find out the location of the device. This application combines both the details that is the sim and the location details and sends it in a message to the predefined number making the tracking of the device an easy  task. Proposed system with features: In our application “mobile theft monitoring”  gives both the sim details as well as the location details of the device which has been stolen. As soon as the user removes the sim and replaces it with another sim the GPS tracks the location of the device and sends it in the form of a message to the predefined number which has been set by the owner of the phone. Additionally this application takes all the sim details such as phone number, sim serial number and the imsi number and sends these details as a message to the predefined number .            "

139,http://1000projects.org/phone-mode-conversion-android-application.html,phone mode conversion android application.," About the project: In this Phone Mode Conversion Android project we will convert any profile mode (silent) to general when the message sent is matched with the password that we had saved. If not it will be as a normal message to the mobile and will be stored in inbox. Existing system limitations: In the previous projects the message sent will be sent as a normal message to the other mobile .But there is no application developed to change the modes of the mobile automatically by receiving a predefined message.            Proposed system with features:  In this project we are proposing a new form of messaging to get the general mode back as a delivery report. In this project we will send a Message to my mobile, it will authenticate the message and reply mode conversion If the message is not matched with the mobile password then it will be normal message.  INTRODUCTION: In present days in the entire world mobiles are used most usually. So the people are expecting some new technologies in mobiles as we know android is an open source. Our project name is “Phone Mode Conversion”. It is an application which can convert any silent, vibrate mode into general mode. This application must be installed in the receiving side of the mobile. When this application is installed in mobile it automatically runs in the background always. There is no need to open the application each and every time once it is installed in any mobile it automatically runs in background until it is uninstalled from the mobile.  Here in this project we set a predefined code which is itself a password and this password must be sent in the form of message from another mobile, then my mobile after receiving that message my application authenticates it and reacts converting from any mode to general. And if the message is not matched it will be received as a normal message. Mostly many of the people are negligence about their mobiles as the mobile will be in silent mode and forget their mobiles somewhere and search for that again but they cannot find it, in such a case this application plays a major role in such a way that he types the predefined code like password set by (developer) and sends it from another mobile.  After my mobile receiving that message the application verifies that code and if it is matched with the code set by the developer, the mode of the mobile will be changed automatically from silent mode to general mode. Then he calls to his mobile and he can hear the ringtone of his mobile and finally he finds it back. This application can be installed in an Android mobiles and the predefined message can be sent from any mobile, this is the major advantage of this application. This application can automatically run in background once it is installed until it is uninstalled.            "

User can synchronize the contact list from phone. Application allows the User to define Schedule in terms of date & time in a day of week. It allows User to select criteria for blocking incoming calls in four ways:  1)   Block all incoming calls 2)   Block incoming calls from only blocked numbers 3)   Block incoming calls from Unknown numbers 4)   Block incoming calls from blocked numbers and Unknown numbers  It silent the incoming call if it falls in defined criteria. Then it sends one SMS (Text Message) to the caller with the text predefined by the user. By saving configuration user can anytime start or stop whole ‘Do Not Disturb’ service using a single button click.    Tools and Technologies: Technology:  Android  Front End Tools:  Eclipse IDE Eclipse provided Android – Device Emulator   Android Software Development Kit (SDK)  Back End Tools:  Db4o Database Engine  (It is a database engine open source object-oriented, its acronym is Data Broil 4 (for) Objects. It is developed to work with developments in Java and .Net. Db4o runs on any operating system that supports these languages.)  Planning  Project Definition  It is an application for mobile phones using the operating  system  Android  whose  function is to automatically mute  calls to contacts has previously been defined as blocked in a time  frame,  both  times  as  daily.  Once  the call  has  been ended,  Do Not Disturb leave the phone in normal mode both volume and vibration.  It also provides added functionality such as send warning messages indicating that you are sleeping (or busy). Preliminary Investigation  The idea about the project is got from the requirement for not to be disturbed by a call from others at some specific time. The application is for android phone, so the development to be done using android technology. In order to block (mute) the incoming call, we have to get the number and check that whether it falls in Blocking criteria, if it is then change the Phone state to silent (if it is General) and on ending the call change state to General and send auto reply.  Selecting the project development Strategy  Since the technology used is android for this application and android uses java as base language for programs I have selected the Object Oriented System Development (OOSD) as the development strategy. Again the entities involved in this application can be considered as Objects and we can also store those Objects in the database. So I have used the Database Engine db4o.               "
154,http://1000projects.org/buddies-hub-keep-in-touch-android-project.html,buddies hub keep in touch android project.," SMS service is provided by the Carrier and they take charges to use that service. People now a day’s paid so many charges to use this SMS service. Simple SMS service is works as first Mobile-x sends message to mobile-y so that first of all it goes to MSC server. MSC server sends that message to centralized SMSC server. Centralized SMSC server sense the receiver phone number and forward same message to receiver i.e. mobile-y network’s MSC server. MSC server push that message to mobile-y and it gets the message which is send by the mobile-x.            If sometimes MSC server get too many connection at that time the delivery period of the SMS will be increased and message is delivered late to receiver. Sometimes if carrier network is down than your important message will not deliver instantly. You send you message to your friend in the morning and it will be delivering to your friend at night or else in the evening. Carrier charges is now a days little bit low in case of you want to sent message in the local state. But while if you want to sent message outside of your state than it will be little bit costly and if you want to sent message out side of your country then it will be more costly. To make SMS service more cost effective and fast delivery of the message here I am going to introduced with new application named as “Buddies Hub – Keep in Touch” Buddies Hub – Keep in Touch is an application in which user can able to send message with his friend without use of the carrier Short Message Service (SMS). BuddiesHub application is works on the device which have Android platform. Now a day’s Android is fastest growing technology in the mobile market. This project is developed to use Android operating system. Android is an object oriented operating system to mobile devices using a modified version of the kernel Linux. When user install apk file of my project first of all user has to register him with that application with the help of his mobile number. Once he is successfully registered with the application then he can login in the application with provided mobile number and password to send messages to his friend. After successful login user can able to send message to his friend and check inbox for any new message is received by him. Main functionality of this application is that user can sent message to his friend and desired person without any cost of the carrier charges only one thing is required is that it must be connected with the internet connection. This application basically works on the platform of Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP). When user send message it will go to server on which database resides and when receiver opens inbox at that time it will recall its message from remote database and display in inbox. User can also reply of that message and forward it also.  Tools and Technology   Front End : Tools :  o   Eclipse Helios o   Microsoft Visual Studio 2008  Technology :  o   Android 2.0 (API Level – 7) o   Dot Net Framework 3.5 o   Jdk1.6.0  Back End : Tools :  o   Microsoft SQL Server 2005  Documentation: Tools :  o   Microsoft Office 2007   Planning  At present people are using carrier service to send message and they will charge from the user for that service. This application allows user to send message to another user of this application based on web. My project planning is that I want people become aware of the free message sending facility.  Project definition  “Message sending Application based on Android without use of carrier SMS service” is the main goal of this system. In this application there is a server which maintains the database of the application and stores the message of all the applicants. Registered user can send the message to other registered user with the help of internet.  Preliminary Investigation  Once I my father got a call from our relative who lives out of India asking for phone number of another relative at that time in call my father gave him phone number but because of some reason he did not note down it correctly so that after some time again he call to my father and asked for sending him text. At that time that charges to send text was too much high and also call charges to my relative was too much because of ISD call at that time I found that these problem could be resolved through available techniques known to me.

Tools: Eclipse, Microsoft Office Visio for Diagram. Microsoft Office Word for Documentation.           Development Platform: Android Development Tool Development Model: OOSD Model Operating System: Windows 7 Tools and Technology   Tools: Front-End: Eclipse Helios 2.   Technology: Android 2.3.3  Planning Project Definition: Android-based Auto SMS application allows the user to send SMS at deferred date and time. After the SMS has been delivered, it will provide the sender with the delivery report along with the location of the receiver.The sender also gets the delivery report and sound. This application works only with internet. The user has an internet connection in the android phone.  Preliminary Investigation: We know that in several mobile devices which are providing a facility for only alarm but not any other facility like sending SMS, email etc so we got an idea for creating this application which is useful for sending a message to wish and remind to others by messaging. Selecting the project development Strategy: The software development process also can be divided into smaller, interacting subprocess. Generally, the software development process can be viewed as a series of transformations, where the output of one transformation becomes the input of the subsequent transformation. Develop a Work Plan:  System Analysis  Requirement Determination Input:  The first user has to add the contact number. Then select date and time and write Message. Then click on send.  Output: When time is come which is set by user the application will automatically start and inform to user for event.  Feasibility Study: Technical Feasibility:  The project is developed on i5 processor with 4 GB RAM. The language used in development is Eclipse Helios 2 and windows environment.  Economics Feasibility:  In this application internet is required in android mobile device.   Requirement Specification: Hardware Requirements: System configuration: Windows OS 2GB RAM, 20 GB Hard Disk. System Design  System design is the process of planning of new systems or one to replace an existing system. During this stage the analyst works with the user to develop a physical model of the system flow chart. The modeling process and its outcome depend upon the system to a certain extent and whether or not object oriented design is followed. The detailed step followed in arriving at the model is known as the methodology. There are several methodologies available. But currently the most popular methodology is known as the unified process. The result of these is a model for the system typically contained in several diagrams. If unified process is followed the diagrams that result might be UML diagrams.  Activity Diagram:  Use Case Diagram:  Sequence Diagram:  User Interface Design:  Screen Snapshots: Main Menu: Main menu available in android phone and icon of the AutoSMS application Write SMS and set date & time: Post Time The main screen of application: Main screen of application which allows the user to write a message, add contact number, set date and time Insert Contact Number: When system time and set date and time matches then it will first insert contact number from the database. Insert into Event: When the user clicks on save button it will add contact number, message, date and time in the database. Sending SMS: When both system date and time and user-specified date and time match it will send SMS automatically. Download Auto SMS Android Application Source Code.            "

158,http://1000projects.org/bus-rapid-transit-system-brts-locator-android-project.html,bus rapid transit system brts locator android project.," Project name: Android based application for Bus Rapid Transit System locator. The Android Project name identifies the use of application. It identifies that it is like such a map application. We have developed our application for those users who prefer to travel in Bus Rapid Transit System BRTS bus of Ahmedabad. This application can be useful to the newer people who are much not familiar with Ahmedabad. This application will show user his/her current location from the phone. For that user should have android OS based phone with internet facility. The application must be installed on your android device. This application will show the user his/her current location and all BRT stops, on selecting various options of the menu user can see Nearest BRT stop from his/her current location , distance from current location to nearest Bus Rapid Transit BRT stop ,next available bus on particular stop , etc.           GPS technology is most developing technology in today’s world in map applications. This technology is used to track the things, persons easily. Mostly this technology was limited up to the military but now it is used for general use to tracking things and persons. All Mobile companies use this technology. Our application is also based on GPS.  Using GPS we are identifying the user`s current location in map. How we get an idea about developing this application? Generally whenever we are traveling in city like Ahmedabad, we might prefer to travel in BRT buses because BRT buses are most fast and cheaper way to travel in Ahmedabad. They are also the most popular way of traveling in Ahmedabad. We thought that if any new person arrives in Ahmedabad and wants to travel/traveling in BRT bus, how he/she can know about the route, nearest BRT stop, the distance of nearest BRT stop etc. So we thought to develop such map application in android for phone where user can see his/her current location and perform other functionality. The phone should contain internet connection to run the application. To run this application user needs android OS based phone with android OS version2.1 or above. The application will/should provide/fulfill following functionality/ requirements: 1)     User should be able see his/her current location from the phone. 2)   When Application icon is clicked and map is loaded, map should show all the BRT stop to the user and also the user`s current location. It depends on the internet speed of your phone. Sometimes user`s current location may not be perfect because of the internet speed. 3)   All Bus Rapid Transit stop should have common icon so that we can identify them as a BRT stop and user`s current location should be identified by different icon so that user can easily identify his/her location from whole map. 4)   When user clicks on any BRT stop on loaded map, it should show display the name of the BRT stop so that user can easily identify BRT stop name. 5)    After loading of map, when user clicks stickly on map for 3-4 seconds then application should generate a menu with three options. They are as follows:  Nearest BRT stop Route and Distance Back  6)   When user clicks on any option of the menu it should perform such an action as it is written on menu. 7)    Suppose user clicks on first option of the menu then application should display message with name of nearest BRT stop name like as follows: Nearest BRT stop : vaniyavad 8)   When user clicks on second option of the menu then application should display message (toast in android) with approximate distance from user`s current location to nearest BRT stop. It should display message like as follows: Distance to vaniyavad : 1.00234 km approximate 9)   On selecting the second option of the menu, application should also generate drawn path (with red color line) from user`s current location to the nearest BRT stop. 10)In this second option, when user clicks on the any BRT stop then application should display the time of next available BRT stop of particular  BRT stop with name of stop. The time bus should in HH:MM format. 11)   When user clicks on Back option of the menu, the state of menu should return on to the main loading screen. Application should be able to exit successfully when user clicks on exit from the phone. 12)  Application should be support in every company’s phone in which android OS with v2.1 or greater is installed. Requirements to Run this Android Application: 1)     User must have Android OS based phone with V2.1 or greater version. 2)   There should be 256 MB minimum memory to and 1 MB storage memory to run this application. 3)   There should be Internet facility available in phone so that we can use this application to load the map. 4)   The user should be in network area where user’s phone supports mobile company’s network so that user can run his/her application. 5)    The phone should contain the functionality of GPS so that gps can locate user`s current location easily. GPS technology is most developing technology in today’s world in map applications. This technology is used to track the things, persons easily. Mostly this technology was limited up to the military but now it is used for general use to tracking things and persons. All Mobile companies use this technology. Screen Snapshots:     1) First screen of the application:                                                       This is the first screen of an application when map is loaded. The map is loaded with user’s current location and all BRT stops. Here Current location is detected by Green downward image arrow and BRT stops are detected by white balloon icons. When you will click on particular BRT stop it will show the name of BRT stop. 2) Menu screen of application:   When you click first screen of map for continuous 3-4 seconds it will generate a menu with  three options. 1)      Nearest BRT stop 2)     Route and Distance 3)     Back On selecting option of menu it will perform particular operation. 3) Nearest BRT stop:   On clicking first option of menu, it will display name of nearest BRT stop with its name. In above screen our current location is DDU University and nearest BRT stop is ddu bus Stop. Application generates BRT stop name using toast.  4) Distance and Schedule:   On selecting second option of the menu application will display distance of the nearest BRT stop from user’s current location. Application will also draw the route with red line from user’s current location to nearest BRT stop  5) Next available bus time:     This screen is generated on clicking on the particular BRT stop. It will display message with next available bus of particular BRT stop.
