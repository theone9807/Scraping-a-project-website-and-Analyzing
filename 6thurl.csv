Commonly pulse width modulated voltage source inverter is widely used for this purpose. The control technique of grid integrated inverters plays a major role for the reduction of harmonic and improvement of power quality in the system. For complete abstract CLICK HERE  ATPE-12 INTELLIGENT MAXIMUM POWER TRACKING AND INVERTER HYSTERESIS CURRENT CONTROL OF GRID-CONNECTED PV SYSTEMS This paper proposes a maximum power point tracking scheme using neural networks for a grid connected photovoltaic system. The system is composed of a photovoltaic array, a boost converter, a three phase inverter and grid. The neural network proposed can predict the required terminal voltage of the array in order to obtain maximum power.  For complete abstract CLICK HERE  ATPE-13 MULTICONVERTER UNIFIED POWER-QUALITY CONDITIONING SYSTEM: MC-UPQC This paper presents a new unified power-quality conditioning system (MC-UPQC), capable of simultaneous compensation for voltage and current in multibus/multifeeder systems. In this configuration, one shunt voltage-source converter (shunt VSC) and two or more series VSCs exist. For complete Abstract CLICK HERE  ATPE-14 ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK BASED DYNAMIC VOLTAGE RESTORER FOR IMPROVEMENT OF POWER QUALITY Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) is a custom power device used as an effective solution in protecting sensitive loads from voltage disturbances in power distribution systems. The efficiency of the control technique, that conducts the switching of the inverters, determines the DVR efficiency. For complete Abstract CLICK HERE      Related Links Latest Electrical Projects List IEEE BE/BTech Projects Power Electronics Projects Renewable Energy Projects Electric Machines and Drives Projects Power Systems Projects"
