The proposed PFC front-end circuit combines the PFC stage and the dc/dc stage into a single stage. Experimental results obtained on a 78-W (24- V/ 3.25-A) prototype circuit show that at VIN = 110 Vac, the proposed PFC front-end for HB LED applications can achieve an efficiency of 87.5%, a power factor of 0.98, and a total harmonic distortion (THD) of 14% with line-currents harmonics that meet the IEC 61000-3-2 Class C standard.

With the integration of the PFC stage and dc/dc stage, significant reduction of component count, size, and cost can be achieved. Experimental results obtained on a prototype show that at VIN = 110 V AC, VO = 24 V, and IO = 3.25 A, the proposed PFC front-end for LED driver has achieved an efficiency of around 87.50%, a power factor of 0.98 and a total harmonic distortion (THD) of 14% for the line current with harmonic contents meeting IEC 61000-3-2 Class C standard. Experimental results have also been obtained at high line when the inductance of the input current shaping inductor is increased. Measured output voltage ripple with an actual LED load at VO = 24 V, IO = 3.8 A is less than 20 mV. Therefore, LED strings can be directly driven without a post regulator, improving the efficiency, lowering the cost, and reducing the size. REFERENCES: [1] J. Y.

http://asokatechnologies.in/design-analysis-board-electric-vehicle-charger-wide-battery-voltage-range-2/,"ABSTRACT: The scarcity of fossil fuel and the increased pollution leads the use of Electric Vehicles (EV) and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV) instead of conventional Internal Combustion (IC) engine vehicles. An Electric Vehicle requires an on-board charger (OBC) to charge the propulsion battery. The objective of the project work is to design a multifunctional on-board charger that can charge the propulsion battery when the Electric Vehicle (EV) connected to the grid. In this case, the OBC plays an AC-DC converter. The surplus energy of the propulsion battery can be supplied to the grid, in this case, the OBC plays as an inverter. The auxiliary battery can be charged via the propulsion battery when PEV is in driving stage. In this case, the OBC plays like a low voltage DC-DC converter (LDC). An OBC is designed with Boost PFC converter at the first stage to obtain unity power factor with low Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) and a Bi-directional DC-DC converter to regulate the charging voltage and current of the propulsion battery. The battery is a Li-Ion battery with a nominal voltage of 360 V and can be charged from depleted voltage of 320 V to a fully charged condition of 420 V. The function of the second stage DC-DC converter is to charge the battery in a Constant Current and Constant Voltage manner. While in driving condition of the battery the OBC operates as an LDC to charge the Auxiliary battery of the vehicle whose voltage is around 12 V. In LDC operation the Bi-Directional DC-DC converter works in Vehicle to Grid (V2G) mode. A 1KW prototype of multifunctional OBC is designed and simulated in MATLAB/Simulink. The power factor obtained at full load is 0.999 with a THD of 3.65 %. The Battery is charged in A CC mode from 320 V to 420 V with a constant battery current of 2.38 A and the charging is switched into CV mode until the battery current falls below 0.24 A. An LDC is designed to charge a 12 V auxiliary battery with CV mode from the high voltage propulsion battery.

The most common method of charging Li-Ion batteries i.e. CC/CV mode charging is obtained by using a DC-DC converter in this chapter. The Battery is charged from 320 V to 420 V in a CC manner with a constant current of 2.38 A and further in a CV manner by keeping the battery voltage fixed at 420 V. The designed DC-DC converter supports Bi-directional power flow and the V2G mode of operation is simulated with the V2G controller, a new concept of LDC is designed here by utilizing the OBC to charge in Auxiliary battery from the propulsion battery. A single stage controller is developed in order to maintain a desired voltage across the Auxiliary battery. REFERENCES: [1] a. Emadi and K.

http://asokatechnologies.in/dynamic-modeling-design-and-simulation-of-a-combined-pem-fuel-cell-and-ultracapacitor-system-for-stand-alone-residential-applications/,"ABSTRACT:   The available power generated from a fuel cell (F C) power plant may not be sufficient to meet sustained load demands, especially during peak demand or transient events encountered in stationary power plant applications. An ultracapacitor (U C) bank can supply a large burst of power, but it cannot store a significant amount of energy. The combined use of F C and U C has the potential for better energy efficiency, reducing the cost of F C technology, and improved fuel usage. In this paper, we present an F C that operates in parallel with a U C bank. A new dynamic model and design methodology for an F C- and U C based energy source for stand-alone residential applications has been developed. Simulation results are presented using MAT LAB, Simulation, and Sim Power Systems environments based on the mathematical and dynamic electrical models developed for the proposed system.

Variation of hydrogen flow rate. CONCLUSION:  A UC-based storage system is designed for a PEMFC operated grid independent home to supply the extra power required during peak demand periods. The parallel combination of the FC system and UC bank exhibits good performance for the stand-alone residential applications during the steady-state, load-switching, and peak power demand. Without the UC bank, the FC system must supply this extra power, thereby increasing the size and cost of the FC system. Results The results corresponding to high peak load demand during short time periods are not shown in order to simulate more realistic load profile. The load profile was created by measuring data at 15-s sampling interval. However, the proposed model can be used for different load profiles consisting of different transients and short-time interruption. Also, it can be extended for use in many areas such as portable devices, heavy vehicles, and aerospace applications. The lifetime of an FC system can be increased if combined FC system and UC bank is used instead of a stand-alone FC system or a hybrid FC and standby battery system. REFERENCES: [1] L. Gao, Z.

http://asokatechnologies.in/improving-dynamic-performance-wind-farms-statcom/,"ABSTRACT: When integrated to the power system, large wind farms can pose voltage control issues among other problems. A thorough study is needed to identify the potential problems and to develop measures to mitigate them. Although integration of high levels of wind power into an existing transmission system does not require a major redesign, it necessitates additional control and compensating equipment to enable (fast) recovery from severe system disturbances. The use of a Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) near a wind farm is investigated for the purpose of stabilizing the grid voltage after grid-side disturbance such as a three phase short circuit fault. The strategy focuses on a fundamental grid operational requirement to maintain proper voltages at the point of common coupling by regulating the voltage. The DC voltage at individual wind turbine (WT) inverters is also stabilized to facilitate continuous operation of wind turbines  during disturbances.   KEYWORDS:  Wind turbine Doubly-fed Induction Generator STATCOM Three phase fault Reactive power    SOFTWARE: MATLAB/SIMULINK BLOCK DIAGRAM:  Fig. 1.

Reactive power of the 125 MVA STATCOM for Case 5.   CONCLUSION: Wind turbines have to be able to ride through a fault without disconnecting from the grid. When a wind farm is connected to a weak power grid, it is necessary to provide efficient power control during normal operating conditions and enhanced support during and after faults. This paper explored the possibility of connecting a STATCOM to the wind power system in order to provide efficient control. An appropriately sized STATCOM can provide the necessary reactive power compensation when connected to a weak grid. Also, a higher rating STATCOM can be used for efficient voltage control and improved reliability in grid connected wind farm but economics limit its rating. Simulation studies have shown that the additional voltage/var support provided by an external device such as a STATCOM can significantly improve the wind turbine’s fault recovery by more quickly restoring voltage characteristics. The extent to which a STATCOM can provide support depends on its rating. The higher the rating, the more support provided. The interconnection of wind farms to weak grids also influences the safety of wind turbine generators. Some of the challenges faced by wind turbines connected to weak grids are an increased number and frequency of faults, grid abnormalities, and voltage and frequency fluctuations that can trip relays and cause generator heating.   REFERENCES:  http://www.awea.org/newsroom/releases/Wind_Power_Capacity_012307. html, accessed Nov. 2007.

http://asokatechnologies.in/matrix-converters-a-technology-review/,"ABSTRACT The matrix converter is an array of controlled semiconductor switches that connects directly the three-phase source to the three-phase load. This converter has several attractive features that have been investigated in the last two decades. In the last few years, an increase in research work has been observed, bringing this topology closer to the industrial application. This paper presents the state-of-the-art view in the development of this converter, starting with a brief historical review. An important part of the paper is dedicated to a discussion of the most important modulation and control strategies developed recently. Special attention is given to present modern methods developed to solve the commutation problem. Some new arrays of power bidirectional switches integrated in a single module are also presented. Finally, this paper includes some practical issues related to the practical application of this technology, like overvoltage protection, use of filters, and ride-through capability.

The solution to this problem has been made possible by using powerful digital devices that are now readily available in the market.   REFERENCES:  Gyugi and B.

http://asokatechnologies.in/control-for-grid-connected/,"ABSTRACT: Intentional islanding describes the condition in which a microgrid or a portion of the power grid, which consists of a load and a distributed generation (DG) system, is isolated from the remainder of the utility system. In this situation, it is important for the microgrid to continue to provide adequate power to the load. Under normal operation, each DG inverter system in the microgrid usually works in constant current control mode in order to provide a preset power to the main grid. When the microgrid is cut off from the main grid, each DG inverter system must detect this islanding situation and must switch to a voltage control mode. In this mode, the microgrid will provide a constant voltage to the local load. This paper describes a control strategy that is used to implement grid-connected and intentional-islanding operations of distributed power generation. This paper proposes an intelligent load-shedding algorithm for intentional islanding and an algorithm of synchronization for grid reconnection.   KEYWORDS:  Distributed generation (DG) Grid-connected operation Intentional-islanding operation Islanding detection Load shedding Synchronization    SOFTWARE: MATLAB/SIMULINK   BLOCK DIAGRAM:    Fig. 1.

Fig. 6.Phase voltage Va with the load-shedding algorithm.  CONCLUSION:  Through this paper, the control, islanding detection, load shedding, and reclosure algorithms have been proposed for the operation of grid-connected and intentional-islanding DGs. A controller was designed with two interface controls: one for grid connected operation and the other for intentional islanding operation. An islanding-detection algorithm, which was responsible for the switch between the two controllers, was presented. The simulation results showed that the detection algorithm can distinguish between islanding events and changes in the loads and can apply the load-shedding algorithms when needed. The reclosure algorithm causes the DG to resynchronize itself with the grid. In addition, it is shown that the response of the proposed control schemes is capable of maintaining the voltages and currents within permissible levels during grid connected and islanding operation modes. The experimental results showed that the proposed control schemes are capable of maintaining the voltages within the standard permissible levels during grid connected and islanding operation modes. In addition, it was shown that the reclosure algorithm causes the DG to resynchronize itself with the grid.   REFERENCES:  Jayaweera, S. Galloway, G. Burt, and J. R.

Advances in power electronic technologies such as Voltage Source Converter (VSC) improves the reliability and functionality of power electronic based controllers hence resulting in increased applications of STATCOM. In this paper, design and implementation of a Distribution type, Voltage Source Converter (VSC) based static synchronous compensator (DSTATCOM) has been carried out. It presents the enhancement of power quality problems, such as voltage sag and swell using Distribution Static Compensator (D-STATCOM) in distribution system. The model is based on Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM) technique. The control of the Voltage Source Converter (VSC) is done with the help of SPWM. The main focus of this paper is to compensate voltage sag and swell in a distribution system. To solve this problem custom power devices are used such as Fixed Compensators (FC, FR), Synchronous Condenser, SVC, SSSC, STATCOM etc. Among these devices Distribution STATCOM (DSTATCOM) is the most efficient and effective modern custom power device used in power distribution networks. DSTATCOM injects a current into the system to mitigate the voltage sag and swell. The work had been carried out in MATLAB environment using Simulink and SIM power system tool boxes. The proposed D-STATCOM model is very effective to enhance the power quality of an isolated distribution system feeding power to crucial equipment in remote areas.

This paper deals with design and simulation of a three phase inverter in MATLAB SIMULINK environment which can be a part of photovoltaic grid connected systems. The converter used is a Voltage source inverter (VSI) which is controlled using synchronous d-q reference frame to inject a controlled current into the grid.

http://asokatechnologies.in/modeling-and-simulation/,"ABSTRACT Model Reference Adaptive System (MRAS) based techniques are one of the best methods to estimate the rotor speed due to its performance and straightforward stability approach. These techniques use two different models (the reference model and the adjustable model) which have made the speed estimation a reliable scheme especially when the motor parameters are poorly known or having large variations. The scheme uses the error vector from the comparison of both models as the feedback for speed estimation. Depending on the type of tuning signal driving the adaptation mechanism, there could be a number of schemes available such as rotor flux based MRAS, back e.m.f based MRAS, reactive power based MRAS and artificial neural network based MRAS. All these schemes have their own trends and tradeoffs. In this paper, the performance of the rotor flux based MRAS (RF-MRAS) and back e.m.f based MRAS (BEMFMRAS) for estimating the rotor speed was studied. Both schemes use the stator equation and rotor equation as the reference model and the adjustable model respectively. The output error from both models is tuned using a PI controller yielding the estimated rotor speed. The dynamic response of the RF-MRAS and BEMF-MRAS sensorless speed estimation is examined in order to evaluate the performance of each scheme. KEYWORDS 1. BEMF-MRAS 2. MRAS 3. Parameter Variations 4.

CONCLUSION Performance of RF-MRAS and BEMF-MRAS estimators based on the tracking capability and parameter sensitivity was presented. The result shows that the BEMFMRAS estimator is more superior to the RF-MRAS estimator at that particular defined range of reference speeds. This is prior to the elimination of pure integrators used in the RF-MRAS scheme. However, the BEMFMRAS estimator is more difficult to design due to the non-linear effect of the adaptation gain constants. Therefore, as a whole, considering all the key criteria of comparison, it can be concluded that the BEMF-MRAS scheme embrace the requirement as a versatile estimator. It demonstrate good tracking capability and superb in insensitivity to parameter variations. REFERENCES [1] M. Ta-Cao, Y. Hori and T.

http://asokatechnologies.in/electric-machines-drives-projects/,"ABSTRACT: A direct maximum power point tracking (MP PT) strategy for P V frameworks has been proposed in this work. This strategy unravels two of the primary disadvantages of the Perturb and Observe (P&O) MP PT, in particular: I) the trade off between the speed and the motions in relentless state, ii) the poor viability in unique conditions, particularly in low i r radiance when the estimation of signs turns out to be progressively touchy to clamor. MP PT The proposed MP PT is intended for single-stage single-arrange matrix associated P V invert er s and depends on evaluating the swell of the quick P V power and voltage, utilizing a second-arrange summed up integrator-based quadrature flag generator (SO G I-Q S G). We broke down the worldwide soundness of the shut circle control framework and approved the proposed calculation through reenactment and analyses on an invert er test stage as per the EN 50530 standard.

http://asokatechnologies.in/direct-maximum-power-point-tracking-method-single-phase-grid-connected-pv-inverters/,"ABSTRACT Present energy need heavily relies on the conventional sources. But the limited availability and steady increase in the price of conventional sources has shifted the focus toward renewable sources of energy. Of the available alternative sources of energy, wind energy is considered to be one of the proven technologies. With a competitive cost for electricity generation, wind energy conversion system (WECS) is nowadays deployed formeeting both grid-connected and stand-alone load demands. However, wind flow by nature is intermittent. In order to ensure continuous supply of power suitable storage technology is used as backup. In this paper, the sustainability of a 4-kW hybrid of wind and battery system is investigated for meeting the requirements of a 3-kW stand-alone dc load representing a base telecom station. A charge controller for battery bank based on turbine maximum power point tracking and battery state of charge is developed to ensure controlled charging and discharging of battery. The mechanical safety of the WECS is assured by means of pitch control technique. Both the control schemes are integrated and the efficacy is validated by testing it with various load and wind profiles in MATLAB/SIMULNIK.  KEYWORDS  Maximum power point tracking (MPPT) Pitch control State of charge (SoC) Wind energy conversion system (WECS).  SOFTWARE: Matlab/Simulink BLOCK DIAGRAM:  Fig. 1. Layout of hybrid wind–battery system for a stand-alone dc load. SIMULATION RESULTS:  Fig. 2. (a) WT and (b) battery parameters under the influence of gradual variation of wind speed.  Fig. 3. (a)WT and (b) battery parameters under the influence of step variation of wind speed.  Fig. 4. (a) WT and (b) battery parameters under the influence of arbitrary variation of wind speed. CONCLUSION The power available from a WECS is very unreliable in nature. So, a WECS cannot ensure uninterrupted power flow to the load. In order to meet the load requirement at all instances, suitable storage device is needed. Therefore, in this paper, a hybrid wind-battery system is chosen to supply the desired load power. To mitigate the random characteristics of wind flow the WECS is interfaced with the load by suitable controllers. The control logic implemented in the hybrid set up includes the charge control of battery bank using MPPT and pitch control of the WT for assuring electrical and mechanical safety. The charge controller tracks the maximum power available to charge the battery bank in a controlled manner. Further it also makes sure that the batteries discharge current is also within the C/10 limit. The current programmed control technique inherently protects the buck converter from over current situation. However, at times due to MPPT control the source power may be more as compared to the battery and load demand. During the power mismatch conditions, the pitch action can regulate the pitch angle to reduce the WT output power in accordance with the total demand. Besides controlling the WT characteristics, the pitch control logic guarantees that the rectifier voltage does not lead to an overvoltage situation. The hybrid wind-battery system along with its control logic is developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK and is tested with various wind profiles. The outcome of the simulation experiments validates the improved performance of the system.  REFERENCES  [1] Sahin, “Progress and recent trends in wind energy,” Progress in Energy Combustion Sci., vol. 30, no. 5, pp. 501–543, 2004.

http://asokatechnologies.in/renewable-energy-projects-for-mtech/,"ABSTRACT The unified power quality conditioner (UPQC) is a custom power device, which mitigates voltage and current-related PQ issues in the power distribution systems. In this paper, a UPQC topology for applications with non-stiff source is proposed. The proposed topology enables UPQC to have a reduced dc-link voltage without compromising its compensation capability. This proposed topology also helps to match the dc-link voltage requirement of the shunt and series active filters of the UPQC. The topology uses a capacitor in series with the interfacing inductor of the shunt active filter, and the system neutral is connected to the negative terminal of the dc-link voltage to avoid the requirement of the fourth leg in the voltage source inverter (VSI) of the shunt active filter. The average switching frequency of the switches in the VSI also reduces, consequently the switching losses in the inverters reduce. Detailed design aspects of the series capacitor and VSI parameters have been discussed in the paper. A simulation study of the proposed topology has been carried out using PSCAD simulator, and the results are presented. Experimental studies are carried out on three-phase UPQC prototype to verify the proposed topology.   SOFTWARE: MATLAB/SIMULINK    BLOCK DIAGRAM:  Fig. 1 Control block diagram for UPQC.   EXPECTED SIMULATION RESULTS:   Fig. 2.

Design of the filter parameters for the series and shunt active filters is explained in detail. The proposed method is validated through simulation and experimental studies in a three-phase distribution system with neutral-clamped UPQC topology (conventional). The proposed modified topology gives the advantages of both the conventional neutral-clamped topology and the four-leg topology. Detailed comparative studies are made for the conventional and modified topologies. From the study, it is found that the modified topology has less average switching frequency, less THDs in the source currents, and load voltages with reduced dc-link voltage as compared to the conventional UPQC topology.   REFERENCES   Bollen, Understanding Power Quality Problems: Voltage Sags and Interruptions.

http://asokatechnologies.in/modified-three-phase-four-wire-upqc-topology-reduced-dc-link-voltage-rating/,"ABSTRACT This article proposes a topology for single-phase two stage grid connected solar photovoltaic (PV) inverter for residential applications. Our proposed grid-connected power converter consists of a switch mode DC-DC boost converter and a H-bridge inverter. The switching strategy of proposed inverter consists with a combination of sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) and square wave along with grid synchronization condition. The performance of the proposed inverter is simulated under grid connected scenario via PSIM. Furthermore, the intelligent PV module system is implemented using a simple maximum power point tracking (MPPT) method utilizing power balance is also employed in order to increase the systems efficiency.   KEYWORDS:  Photovoltaic DC-DC Boost Converter MPPT SPWM Grid Connected Power Electronics Grid Tie Inverter(GTI)     CIRCUIT DIAGRAM:  Figure 1.

Output voltage’s FFT (a) before filtering and (b) after filtering   CONCLUSION: The main purpose of this paper is to establish a model for the grid-connected photovoltaic system with maximum power point tracking function for residential application. A single phase two-stage grid-connected photovoltaic inverter with a combination of SPWM and square-wave switching strategy is designed using PSIM. In the proposed design, an MPPT algorithm using a boost converter is designed to operate using (P&O) method to control the PWM signals of the boost converter, which is adapted to the maximum power tracking in our PV system. Instead of using line frequency transformer at the inverter output terminals, a DC-DC boost converter is used between solar panel and inverter that efficiently amplify the 24V PV arrays output into 312V DC, which is then transformed into line frequency (50Hz) sinusoidal ac 220V rms voltage by the inverter and thereby reducing the system losses and ensures high voltage gain and higher efficiency output. The simulation results show that the proposed grid connected photovoltaic inverter trace the maximum point of solar cell array power and then converts it to a high quality ripple free sinusoidal ac power with a voltage THD below 0.1% which is very much lower than IEEE 519 standard. The simulation also confirms the proposed photovoltaic inverter can be applied as a GTI and able to supplies the AC power to utility grid line with nearly unity power factor.   REFERENCES [1] W.

http://asokatechnologies.in/single-phase-grid-connected/,"ABSTRACT: It is known from the fact that Harmonic Distortion is one of the main power quality problems frequently encountered by the utilities. The harmonic problems in the power supply are caused by the non-linear characteristic based loads. The presence of harmonics leads to transformer heating, electromagnetic interference and solid state device mal-functioning. Hence keeping in view of the above concern, research has been carried out to mitigate harmonics. This paper presents an analysis and control methods for hybrid active power filter using Discrete Pulse Width Modulation and Space Vector Pulse Width Modulation (SVPWM) for Power Conditioning in distribution systems. The Discrete PWM has the function of voltage stability, and harmonic suppression. The reference current can be calculated by‘d-q’ transformation. In SVPWM technique, the Active Power Filter (APF) reference voltage vector is generated instead of the reference current, and the desired APF output voltage is generated by SVPWM. The THD will be decreased significantly by SVPWM technique than the Discrete PWM technique based Hybrid filters. Simulations are carried out for the two approaches by using MATLAB, it is observed that the %THD has been improved from 1.79 to 1.61 by the SVPWM technique.

The performance of APF with these methods is done in MATLAB/Simulink. The algorithm will be able to reduce the complexity of the control circuitry. The harmonic spectrum under non-linear load conditions shows that reduction of harmonics is better. Under unbalanced linear load, the magnitude of three-phase source currents are made equal and also with balanced linear load the voltage and current are made in phase with each other. The simulation study of two level inverter is carried out using SVPWM because of its better utilization of DC bus voltage more efficiently and generates less harmonic distortion in three-phase voltage source inverter. This SVPWM control methodology can be used with series APF to compensate power quality distortions. From the simulated results of the filtering techniques, it is observed that Total Harmonic Distortion is reduced to an extent by the SVPWM Hybrid filter when compared to the Discrete PWM filtering technique i.e. from 1.78% to 1.61%.

http://asokatechnologies.in/analysis-of-discrete-space-vector-pwm-controlled-hybrid-active-filters-for-power-quality-enhancement/,"ABSTRACT The increasing trend towards usage of precisely controlled, high torque, efficient and low noise motors for dedicated applications has attracted the at tention of researcher in Brushless DC (BLDC) motors. BLDC motors can act as an acceptable alternative to the conventional motors like Induction Motors, Switched Reluctance Motors etc. This paper presents a detailed study on the performance of a BLDC motor supplying different types of loads, and at the same time, deploying different control techniques. An advance Fuzzy PID controller is compared with the commonly used PID controller. The load variations considered are of the most common types, generally encountered in practice. A comparison has been carried out in this paper by observing the dynamic speed response of motor at the time of application as well as at the time of removal of the load. The BLDC motors suffer from a major drawback of having jerky behavior at the time of load removal. The study reveals that irrespective of the type of controller used, the gradual load variation produces better results as against sudden load variations. It is further observed that in addition to other dynamic features, the jerks produced at the time of load removal also get improved to a large extent with Fuzzy PID controller. The speed torque characteristics un raveled the fact that the jerks are minimum at the time of gradual load removal with Fuzzy PID controller in place. An attempt has been made to define these jerks by ‘Perturbation Window’.

CONCLUSION A model is developed in this paper for BLDC Drive using MATLAB/SIMULINK to analyze its performance with PID controller and with Fuzzy PID Controller when the motor is subjected to the most commonly encountered sudden load variations as well as gradual load variations under constant speed operation. The BLDC drive gives better performance if the load is changed gradually. Further, it is found that the transient response of the drive in terms of overshoot, under shoot, peak time and settling time are improved with the use of FPID. Speed torque characteristics of The drive are also used for all the conditions to assess the overall behavior of the machine. The commonly experienced major drawback of the jerks of BLDC motors at the time of load removal has been found to get reduced by 50% incase of sudden load removal and by about 80% incase of gradual load removal by applying FPID controller as against the use of classical PID controller.

The formulated control design has been effectively orchestrated to correct the power factor in addition providing good voltage regulation. The transient performance has been portrayed to up-heave the strength of the control structure with an adequate output regulation and effective harmonic elimination. The control plan has been nurtured to standardize the THD level of the system that prevents the adverse effects of harmonics being injected in the grid. The exclusion of additional passive components and interleaving configuration has been fostered to reduce the size thus making it more adaptive to low cost compact electronic applications with high standards .  REFERENCES: [1] M.

http://asokatechnologies.in/solar-photovoltaic-powered-sailing-boat-using-buck-converter/,"ABSTRACT: This paper presents a new unified power-quality conditioning system (MC-UPQC), capable of simultaneous compensation for voltage and current in multibus/multifeeder systems. In this configuration, one shunt voltage-source converter (shunt VSC) and two or more series VSCs exist. The system can be applied to adjacent feeders to compensate for supply-voltage and load current imperfections on the main feeder and full compensation of supply voltage imperfections on the other feeders. In the proposed configuration, all converters are connected back to back on the dc side and share a common dc-link capacitor. Therefore, power can be transferred from one feeder to adjacent feeders to compensate for sag/swell and interruption. The performance of the MC-UPQC as well as the adopted control algorithm is illustrated by simulation. The results obtained in PSCAD/EMTDC on a two-bus/two-feeder system show the effectiveness of the proposed configuration.

The new configuration is named multi converter unified power-quality conditioner (MC-UPQC). Compared to a conventional UPQC, the proposed topology is capable of fully protecting critical and sensitive loads against distortions, sags/swell, and interruption in two-feeder systems. The idea can be theoretically extended to multibus/multifeeder systems by adding more series VSCs. The performance of the MC-UPQC is evaluated under various disturbance conditions and it is shown that the proposed MC-UPQC offers the following advantages: 1)  power transfer between two adjacent feeders for sag/swell and interruption compensation; 2) compensation for interruptions without the need for a battery storage system and, consequently, without storage capacity limitation; 3) sharing power compensation capabilities between two adjacent feeders which are not connected.

http://asokatechnologies.in/multiconverter-unified-power-quality-conditioning-system-mc-upqc/,"ABSTRACT Buck converter has a good aptitude for LED driver application. Here a new technique introduced to control and model a buck converter in the closed loop condition using Lagrange equation. To improve the final model accuracy, parasitic elements of the converter are taken into account. The main advantage of this method is its novelty and simple implementation. Also, the converter power factor has improved under critical current control (C3) technique. Frequency response and step response of the small signal model are derived and analysed. The theoretical predictions are tested and validated by means of PSIM software. Finally, precise agreement between the proposed model and the simulation results has obtained.   INDEX TERMS:  Power factor correction LED driver Buck converter Small signal model. critical current    SOFTWARE: MATLAB/SIMULINK    CIRCUIT DIAGRAM  Fig. 1.

Power factor correction is done using critical current control (C3) or borderline conduction mode (BCM). Also, the Lagrange differential equations are employed here as an efficient tool for switching converter modeling in the closed loop condition. The proposed modeling technique gives the designer better intuition about the circuit under study rather than traditional state space averaging (SSA) method. SSA is a tedious and fully mathematical tool for switching converters modeling. In addition, parasitic elements of the converter have taken into account so it helps to select the circuit parts value correctly before manufacturing process. Dynamic behaviour of the converter is analysed in both frequency and time domain such as transfer functions and step response. A PI compensator is employed in the closed feedback loop to stabilize and modulate the reference current amplitude corresponding to the demanded power. Since this method relying on the averaging method, then the final model is reliable from 0 Hz up to half of switching frequency according to the Nyquist theorem. Finally, the simulation results confirm the proposed model exactness and indicate the rapidity of system step response under compelling conditions.   REFERENCES  Jardini J.A. et al., Power Flow Control in the Converters Interconnecting AC-DC Meshed Systems, Przegląd Elektrotechniczny, 01(2015), 46-49.

http://asokatechnologies.in/critical-current-control-c3-modeling/,"ABSTRACT: This paper deals with the reduction of power drawn from the supply system during generation un-certainties in D.C Micro grids using D.C Electric springs. In this work supply system is modeled using a fluctuating power source and a battery i.e. during generation uncertainties the system runs on battery support. A small micro grid system which has a critical load and non-critical load has been taken for the study and the simulations are done in MATLAB. The objective of the proposed work is to conserve power by making the non-critical loads draw less power during generation uncertainties which in turn relives the battery and renewable generator to the possible extent. D.C Electric springs are extension to A.C Electric springs used in A.C systems which make the non-critical loads draw less power by adjusting the voltage supplied to them. The D.C Electric spring presented in this work is different from the existing technologies present in the literature in terms of the circuitry used and its interpretation with mechanical spring. KEYWORDS:  C Electric spring Noncritical load C micro grid Supply system Generation uncertainties   SOFTWARE: MATLAB/SIMULINK BLOCK DIAGRAM:  Fig. 1 Simulation diagram of the considered D.C Micro grid system  EXPECTED SIMULATION RESULTS:     Fig. 2 Variations in the output voltage of the source considered for the study    Fig. 3 Average value of Voltage across the Critical load    Fig. 4 Average value of D.C voltage across the non-critical load  Fig. 5 Average value Power drawn by the Critical load  Fig. 6 Average value of the power drawn by the non-critical load CONCLUSION:  From the proposed work it can be established that usage of D.C Electric springs in the existing D.C micro grid systems can largely relieve the battery and the renewable generator during un-certainties in the power generation by the source. For the considered fluctuation pattern of the output voltage there is a saving of 8 % in the power drawn from the battery and also by looking at the saving in the power drawn from the supply system during generation uncertainties it can be seen that there is 12 % reduction in the power drawn which means that using D.C Electric Spring not only the battery storage requirement gets lesser but also the power drawn from the supply system as well as the source gets reduced which means that usage of D.C Electric spring in the micro grid system will realize both the objectives. It can be noted that for a different pattern of output voltage of the source the reduction in power drawn will be different. The future scope of this work can be on developing suitable devices or equipment which can operate at higher voltage tolerance and such devices will be useful if the micro grid structure is weakly regulated. Further this type of technologies can be used in D.C micro grids to reduce the energy storage requirements in future.  REFERENCES: [1] Kakigano H, Miura Y, Ise T.

http://asokatechnologies.in/dc-electric-springs/,"ABSTRACT Direct torque control (DTC) is one of the most excellent control strategies of torque control in induction machine. It is considered as an alternative to the field oriented control (FOC) or vector control technique. These two control strategies are different on the operation principle but their objectives are the same. They aim to control effectively the torque and flux. Torque control of an induction machine based on DTC strategy has been developed and a comprehensive study is present in this research. The performance of this control method has been demonstrated by simulations performed using a versatile simulation package, Matlab/Simulink. Several numerical simulations have been carried out in a steady state and transient operation on a speed control mode. KEYWORDS 1. Direct torque control 2. Induction machine 3. Vector control 4.

http://asokatechnologies.in/control-of-induction-motor-drive-using-space-vector-pwm/,"ABSTRACT:  Along with increasing demand on improving power quality, the most popular technique that has been used is Active Power Filter (APF); this is because APF can easily eliminate unwanted harmonics, improve power factor and overcome voltage sags. This paper will discuss and analyze the simulation result for a three-phase shunt active power filter using MATLAB/SIMULINK program. This simulation will implement a non-linear load and compensate line current harmonics under balance and unbalance load. As a result of the simulation, it is found that an active power filter is the better way to reduce the total harmonic distortion (THD) which is required by quality standards IEEE-519.   KEYWORDS:  APF d-q theorem, THD Power Quality ADS Instantaneous Power theory    SOFTWARE: MATLAB/SIMULINK  BLOCK DIAGRAM:  Fig.1.

The system is modeled in m-file, thus characteristic curves of the inverter are obtained for different parameters. The THD values of grid current for 3 kHz and 9 kHz with 650V DC-link voltage are 10.22%and 3.41%. For verification of the modeling results, the system is simulated in Simulink. The control algorithm is implemented in Embedded Matlab Function in the simulation. The results are compared at 3 kHz and 9 kHz switching frequency, and modeling results are verified with simulation results that are 10.22% are 3.44%. In order to verify the modeling and simulation results, a laboratory prototype that is controlled by dSPACE DS1103 control board is realized. In the experimental study, THD values are measured as 10.68 and 3.59%. Furthermore, dynamic response and reactive power generation capability of the inverter are presented. The experimental results verify the modeling and simulation results. This verification shows that the system can be designed for various system and control parameters using the design curves. The study is realized for 10kW power but it is possible to obtain the characteristic curves for differen power values. According to results, the switching frequency or filter inductance value should be high to meet THD limit. Furthermore, efficiency is another important performance indicator. The efficiency at rated power and the european efficiency of the inverter is 97.6% and 97.2%  at 9 kHz. REFERENCES: [1] F. Blaabjerg, M. Liserre and K.

The topology consists of two standard two-level inverters connected in cascade through open-end windings of a three-phase transformer. The dc link voltages of the inverters are regulated at different levels to obtain four-level operation. The simulation study is carried out in MATLAB/SIMULINK to predict the performance of the proposed scheme under balanced and unbalanced supply-voltage conditions. A laboratory prototype is developed to validate the simulation results. The control scheme is implemented using the TMS320F28335 digital signal processor. Further, stability behavior of the topology is investigated. The dynamic model is developed and transfer functions are derived. The system behavior is analyzed for various operating conditions.  KEYWORDS  DC-link voltage balance Multilevel inverter Power quality (PQ) Static compensator (STATCOM)   SOFTWARE:  MATLAB/SIMULINK BLOCK DIAGRAM  Fig. 1.

CONCLUSION DC-link voltage balance is one of the major issues in cascaded inverter-based STATCOMs. In this paper, a simple var compensating scheme is proposed for a cascaded two-level inverter- based multilevel inverter. The scheme ensures regulation of dc-link voltages of inverters at asymmetrical levels and reactive power compensation. The performance of the scheme is validated by simulation and experimentations under balanced and unbalanced voltage conditions. Further, the cause for instability when there is a change in reference current is investigated. The dynamic model is developed and transfer functions are derived. System behavior is analyzed for various operating conditions. From the analysis, it is inferred that the system is a non minimum phase type, that is, poles of the transfer function always lie on the left half of the -plane. However, zeros shift to the right half of the -plane for certain operating conditions. For such a system, oscillatory instability for high controller gains exists. REFERENCES [1] N. G.

http://asokatechnologies.in/mtech-power-systems-projects-2/,"ABSTRACT: A voltage source inverter is commonly used to supply a three-phase induction motor with variable frequency and variable voltage for variable speed applications. A suitable pulse width modulation (PWM) technique is employed to obtain the required output voltage in the line side of the inverter. The different methods for PWM generation can be broadly classified into Triangle comparison based PWM (TCPWM) and Space Vector based PWM (SVPWM). In TCPWM methods such as sine-triangle PWM, three phase reference modulating signals are compared against a common triangular carrier to generate the PWM signals for the three phases. In SVPWM methods, a revolving reference voltage vector is provided as voltage reference instead of three phase modulating waves. The magnitude and frequency of the fundamental component in the line side are controlled by the magnitude and frequency, respectively, of the reference vector. The highest possible peak phase fundamental is very less in sine triangle PWM when compared with space vector PWM. Space Vector Modulation (SVM) Technique has become the important PWM technique for three phase Voltage Source Inverters for the control of AC Induction, Brushless DC, Switched Reluctance and Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors. The study of space vector modulation technique reveals that space vector modulation technique utilizes DC bus voltage more efficiently and generates less harmonic distortion when compared with Sinusoidal PWM (SPWM) technique. In this paper first a model for Space vector PWM is made and simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK software and its performance is compared with Sinusoidal PWM. The simulation study reveals that Space vector PWM utilizes dc bus voltage more effectively and generates less THD when compared with sine PWM.

In this paper first comparative analysis of Space Vector PWM with conventional SPWM for a two level Inverter is carried out. The Simulation study reveals that SVPWM gives 15% enhanced fundamental output with better quality i.e. lesser THD compared to SPWM. PWM strategies viz. SPWM and SVPWM are implemented in MATLAB/SIMULINK software and its performance is compared with conventional PWM techniques. Owing to their fixed carrier frequencies cfin conventional PWM strategies, there are cluster harmonics around the multiples of carrier frequency. PWM strategies viz. Sinusoidal PWM and SVPWM utilize a changing carrier frequency to spread the harmonics continuously to a wideband area so that the peak harmonics are reduced greatly.

http://asokatechnologies.in/simulation-and-comparison-of-spwm-and-svpwm-control-for-three-phase-inverter/,"ABSTRACT: Injection of the wind power into an electric grid affects the power quality. The performance of the wind turbine and thereby power quality are determined on the basis of measurements and the norms followed according to the guideline specified in International Electro-technical Commission standard, IEC-61400. The influence of the wind turbine in the grid system concerning the power quality measurements are-the active power, reactive power, variation of voltage, flicker, harmonics, and electrical behavior of switching operation and these are measured according to national/international guidelines. The paper study demonstrates the power quality problem due to installation of wind turbine with the grid. In this proposed scheme STATic COMpensator (STATCOM) is connected at a point of common coupling with a battery energy storage system (BESS) to mitigate the power quality issues. The battery energy storage is integrated to sustain the real power source under fluctuating wind power. The STATCOM control scheme for the grid connected wind energy generation system for power quality improvement is simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK in power system block set. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme relives the main supply source from the reactive power demand of the load and the induction generator. The development of the grid co-ordination rule and the scheme for improvement in power quality norms as per IEC-standard on the grid has been presented.   KEYWORDS:  International electro-technical commission (IEC) power quality wind generating system (WGS)    SOFTWARE: MATLAB/SIMULINK   BLOCK DIAGRAM:    Fig.1.System operational scheme in grid system.   EXPECTED SIMULATION RESULTS:    Fig. 1.

The operation of the control system developed for the STATCOM-BESS in MATLAB/SIMULINK for maintaining the power quality is simulated. It has a capability to cancel out the harmonic parts of the load current. It maintains the source voltage and current in-phase and support the reactive power demand for the wind generator and load at PCC in the grid system, thus it gives an opportunity to enhance the utilization factor of transmission line.

The setup allows the wind turbine system an uninterruptible fault ride-through of voltage dips. The DVR can compensate the faulty line voltage, while the DFIG wind turbine can continue its nominal operation as demanded in actual grid codes. Simulation results for a 2 MW wind turbine and measurement results on a 22 kW laboratory setup are presented, especially for asymmetrical grid faults.

CONCLUSION: The application of a DVR connected to a wind-turbine-driven DFIG to allow uninterruptible fault ride-through of grid voltage faults is investigated. The DVR can compensate the faulty line voltage, while the DFIG wind turbine can continue its nominal operation and fulfill any grid code requirement without the need for additional protection methods. The DVR can be used to protect already installed wind turbines that do not provide sufficient fault ride-through behavior or to protect any distributed load in a microgrid. Simulation results for a 2 MW wind turbine under an asymmetrical two-phase grid fault show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in comparison to the low-voltage ridethrough of the DFIG using a crowbar where continuous reactive power production is problematic. Measurement results under transient grid voltage dips on a 22 kW laboratory setup are presented to verify the results. REFERENCES: [1] M. Tsili and S.

The topology uses only nine IGBT devices for ac to ac conversion through a quasi dc-link circuit. Compared with the conventional back-to-back PWM VSC using 12 switches and the matrix converter that uses 18, the number of switches in the proposed converter is reduced by 33% and 50%, respectively. The proposed converter features sinusoidal inputs and outputs, unity input power factor, and low manufacturing cost. The operating principle of the converter was elaborated, and modulation schemes for constant and VF operations were developed. Simulation results including a semiconductor loss analysis and comparison were provided, which reveal that the proposed converter, while working in CF mode, has an overall higher efficiency than the B2B 2L-VSC at the expense of uneven loss distribution. However, the VF-mode version requires IGBT devices with higher ratings and dissipates significantly higher losses, and thus, is not as attractive as its counterpart. Experimental verification is carried out on a 5-kVA prototype system.   REFERENCES:  Wu, High-power Converters and AC Drives. Piscataway, NJ: IEEE/Wiley, 2006.  Singh, B. N. Singh, A. Chandra, K.

The design of the proposed module makes some preferable features with a better quality than similar modules such as the low number of semiconductors and DC sources and low switching frequency. Also, this module is able to create a negative level without any additional circuit such as an H-bridge which causes reduction of voltage stress on switches. Cascade connection of the proposed structure leads to a modular topology with more levels and higher voltages.

It can be used in high voltage high power applications with unequal DC sources. As E-Type module can be easily modularized, it can be used in cascade arrangements to form high voltage outputs with low stress on semiconductors and lowering the number of devices. Modular connection of these modules leads to achieve more voltage levels with different possible paths. It causes an improvement in the reliability of the modular inverter which enables it to use different paths in case of malfunction for a switch or a driver.

http://asokatechnologies.in/envelope-type-e-type-module-asymmetric-multilevel-inverters-reduced-components/,"ABSTRACT This study analyzes various anti-islanding (AI) protection relays when the islanding condition of Grid-Tied PV (photovoltaic) System appears at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC) between the PV Solar Power System and the power grid. The main purpose of the study is to determine the performance of several AI prevention schemes in detecting the presence of an island, by monitoring the detection time of the islanding condition through different methods. The devices used to implement the methods include over-current and under-current (OI/UI) relays, over-voltage and under-voltage (OV/UV) relays, over-frequency and under-frequency (OF/UF) relays, rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) and Vector Shift relays. The protection was tested in case of complete disconnection of the PV system from the electric power grid and also in case of various grid faults.   SOFTWARE: MATLAB/SIMULINK CIRCUIT DIAGRAM:   Fig. 1.

The PV System is completely disconnected from EPS and continues to energize a 20kV utility grid at 50Hz, and respectively various grid faults occurs at 5km away from the PCC of the PV System. The effectiveness of different AI detection algorithms is tested and the impact on network fault conditions and relays behavior during islanding is studied. From the results provided by the performed Matlab/Simulink simulations, it was observed that using traditional relays for islanding detection such as the OC or UV resulted in significantly better performance in respect to detection time of islanding conditions. The ROCOF and Vector Shift relays have a detection time comparable with frequency relays. However, if the ROCOF threshold is exceeded, the formation of an island is quickly detected. The terminal voltage of PV inverter needs to exceed a certain threshold when the frequency is not stabilized by VSC. The UC relay failed entirely to detect the islanding in both analyzed cases. The effects of unintentional islanding were observed from simulation of transient grid faults on a power distribution network. The protection equipment needs to distinguish between islanding event and grid faults. The Grid-Tied PV System protections should detect the fault and trip before islanding occurs as a result of the opening of the circuit breaker in response to a downstream fault. In order to minimize these effects and to perform according to the. international standards, the AI relays have to be inserted at the points where islanding conditions may occur. The theoretical simulation results are useful to select these points and design the AI protection devices for Grid-Tied PV Systems.   REFERENCES  [1] D. Rekioua and E.

Implementation of experimental set up for P V based power system with DC-DC converter to validate the performance of the system is not always possible due to practical constraints. Software based simulation model helps to analyze the performance of P V and a common circuit based model which could be used for validating any commercial P V module will be more helpful. Simulation of mathematical model for Photo voltaic (P V) module and DC-DC boost converter is presented in this paper. The model presented in this paper can be used as a generalized P V module to analyze the performance of any commercially available P V modules. I-V characteristics and P-V characteristics of P V module under different temperature and irradiation level can be obtained using the model. The design of DC-DC boost converter is also discussed in detail.

Matlab/Simulink simulates the DC-DC boost converter and the converter generates  the results with constant DC input supply and by interconnecting the P V module with it. The results shows close match between the output of converter with constant DC input and the P V fed converter. The P V fed DC-DC boost converter generates the output voltage and current for change of irradiation levels at constant temperature is also presented. REFERENCES:  [1] J. A.

http://asokatechnologies.in/simulation-analysis-stand-alone-photovoltaic-system-boost-converter-using-matlab-simulink/,"ABSTRACT: The scientific principle of “mechanical springs” was described by the British physicist Robert Hooke in the 1660’s. Since then, there has not been any further development of the Hooke’s law in the electric regime. In this paper, this technological gap is filled by the development of “electric springs.” The scientific principle, the operating modes, the limitations, and the practical realization of the electric springs are reported. It is discovered that such novel concept has huge potential in stabilizing future power systems with substantial penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources. This concept has been successfully demonstrated in a practical power system setup fed by an ac power source with a fluctuating wind energy source. The electric spring is found to be effective in regulating the mains voltage despite the fluctuation caused by the intermittent nature of wind power. Electric appliances with the electric springs embedded can be turned into a new generation of smart loads, which have their power demand following the power generation profile. It is envisaged that electric springs, when distributed over the power grid, will offer a new form of power system stability solution that is independent of information and communication technology.

[Electric spring is programmed for both voltage boosting and suppression functions.].  CONCLUSION: The Hooke’s law on mechanical springs has been developed into an electric spring concept with new scientific applications for modern society. The scientific principles, operating modes and limits of the electric spring are explained. An electric spring has been practically tested for both voltage support and suppression, and for shaping load demand (of about 2.5 kW) to follow the fluctuating wind power profile in a 10 kVA power system fed by an ac power source and a wind power simulator. The electric springs can be incorporated into many existing noncritical electric loads such as water heaters and road lighting systems [26] to form a new generation of smart loads that are adaptive to the power grid. If many noncritical loads are equipped with such electric springs and distributed over the power grid, these electric springs (similar to the spring array in Fig. 1) will provide a highly reliable and effective solution for distributed energy storage, voltage regulation and damping functions for future power systems. Such stability measures are also independent of information and communication technology (ICT). This discovery based on the three-century-old Hooke’s law offers a practical solution to the new control paradigm that the load demand should follow the power generation in future power grid with substantial renewable energy sources. Unlike traditional reactive power compensation methods, electric springs offer both reactive power compensation and real power variation in the noncritical loads. With many countries determined to de-carbonize electric power generation for reducing global warming by increasing renewable energy up to 20% of the total electrical power output by 2020 [22]–[25], electric spring is a novel concept that enables human society to use renewable energy as nature provides. The Hooke’s law developed in the 17th century has laid down the foundation for stability control of renewable power systems in the 21st century.  REFERENCES: [1] Hooke’s law—Britannica Encyclopedia [Online].

http://asokatechnologies.in/electric-springs-new-smart-grid-technology-2/,"ABSTRACT: This paper presents a new component within the flexible ac-transmission system (FACTS) family, called distributed power-flow controller (DPFC). The DPF Controller is derived from the unified power-flow controller (UPFC). The DPFC can be considered as a UPFC with an eliminated common dc link. The active power exchange between the shunt and series converters, which is through the common dc link in the UPFC, is now through the transmission lines at the third- harmonic frequency. The DPFC employs the distributed FACTS (D-FACTS) concept, which is to use multiple small-size single-phase converters instead of the one large-size three-phase series converter in the UPFC. The large number of series converters provides redundancy, thereby increasing the system reliability. As the D-FACTS converters are single-phase and floating with respect to the ground, there is no high-voltage isolation required between the phases. Accordingly, the cost of the DPFC system is lower than the UPFC. The DPFC has the same control capability as the UPFC, which comprises the adjustment of the line impedance, the transmission angle, and the bus voltage. The principle and analysis of the DPFC are presented in this paper and the corresponding experimental results that are carried out on a scaled prototype are also shown.   KEYWORDS:  AC–DC power conversion Load flow control Power electronics Power semiconductor devices Power-transmission    SOFTWARE: MATLAB/SIMULINK   BLOCK DIAGRAM:  Fig. 1.

Step response: bus voltage and current at the Δ of the transformer   CONCLUSION:  This paper has presented a new concept called Distributed power flow controller. It emerges from the UPFC and inherits the control capability of the UPFC, which is the simultaneous adjustment of the line impedance, the transmission angle, and the bus-voltage magnitude. The common dc link between the shunt and series converters, which is used for exchanging active power in the UPFC, is eliminated. This power is now transmitted through the transmission line at the third-harmonic frequency. The series converter of the DPFC employs the D-FACTS concept, which uses multiple small single-phase converters instead of one large-size converter. The reliability of the DPFC is greatly increased because of the redundancy of the series converters. The total cost of this controller is also much lower than the UPFC, because no high-voltage isolation is required at the series-converter part and the rating of the components of is low. The DPFC concept has been verified by an experimental setup. It is proved that the shunt and series converters in the DPFC can exchange active power at the third-harmonic frequency, and the series converters are able to inject controllable active and reactive power at the fundamental frequency.   REFERENCES:  -H.

http://asokatechnologies.in/facts-device-distributed-power-flow-controller-dpfc-2/,"ABSTRACT Microgrid connected This article studies the control configuration of a microgrid-connected photovoltaic (MCPV) source. In the control of an MCPV, maximum power point (MPP) tracking, droop control, and dc bus voltage regulation are the main required functions. To increase their penetration in the microgrid, MCPV sources have to participate in the microgrid’s frequency regulation. Consequently, MCPVs may be forced to depart from MPP for short periods of time. In this article, a control method is proposed to operate the MCPV in the MPP at all times except when there is a need to stabilize the frequency. The method achieves this objective autonomously without the need to change the control configuration. This method is explained, and its superiority over other controllers to achieve the same objective is investigated. The suggested control configurations are validated through simulation studies and experiments.

Fig 8.The hybrid MCPV experimental results: (a) the power of source2 and (b) the value of dp/dv of the hybrid MCPVs.  CONCLUSION In this article, the control strategies for the MCPVs were investigated. The considered MCPVs comprised the PV source: dc/dc and dc/ac converters. The need for a new control configuration for MCPV sources to participate in the frequency and voltage regulation in addition to the MPPT controller was justified. One way to control the MCPVs was to switch between two controllers, one for MPPT and the other to perform droop control. The combination of the two controllers is called a hybrid controller. The hybrid controller suf In this article, the control strategies for the MCPVs were investigated. The considered MCPVs comprised the PV source: dc/dc and dc/ac converters. The need for a new control configuration for MCPV sources to participate in the frequency and voltage regulation in addition to the MPPT controller was justified. One way to control the MCPVs was to switch between two controllers, one for MPPT and the other to perform droop control. The combination of the two controllers is called a hybrid controller. The hybrid controller suffered from two problems. The first was the need for an external switching signal to switch from one controller to the other, indicating a lack of plug-and-play capability. The second problem was the poor transient in the dynamics whenever there was a change in the controller or the load. A new controller was then proposed that achieved the MPPT, droop control, and dc bus voltage regulation without the need to switch between different configurations. The proposed controller was denoted as the universal controller. In this controller, a dc bus regulator controls the dc bus voltage by adjusting the duty ratio of the dc/dc converter, while both the droop controller and the MPPT controller drive the dc/ ac inverter phase. The controllers were tuned in such a way that, whenever there is a significant change in the load, the droop controller response is dominant to stabilize the frequency of the microgrid. Later, the MPPT moves the operating point to the MPP automatically but smoothly to avoid any disruption in the frequency. The proposed controllers were tested by simulations and experiments, where the validity of the method was verified in terms of stabilizing the frequency, maximizing the power production, regulating the dc bus voltage, and operating autonomously without the need for an external switching decision.
