The shunt APFs are well established filter to compensate current harmonics, reactive power to maintain the power factor unity. The compensation is highly influenced by the DC-link voltage regulation. The calculated PI controller gain parameters conventionally, are giving satisfactory results under steady state condition of the load. However, tuning of the PI controller parameters under fast changing loads are very difficult. To improve the dynamic performance of the system and optimize the gain parameters of the PI controller, a PSO technique is proposed. The modified p-q theory uses a composite observer filter to extract fundamental component of voltage from the distorted supply voltage for the further process of calculating reference current. A complete comparison of conventional and PSO based PI controller gain tuning have been simulated using MATLAB® Simulink software under different supply voltage and load condition of the system. The results show that the dynamic response is improved with PSO based PI tuning compared to conventional PI tuning.  KEYWORDS  Shunt Active power filters (SAPF) PI controller Particle swarm optimization (PSO)  SOFTWARE: MATLAB/SIMULINK BLOCK  DIAGRAM:  Fig. 1 Optimal design of PI controller gain values using PSO EXPECTED SIMULATION RESULTS  Fig. 2.

The modified composite observer filter is an extracted fundamental frequency component of voltage from distorted supply without phase delay which further processed in the calculation of the reference current. The comparison of conventional PI tuning and PSO based tuning is tested for dynamic condition of the load. The proposed control scheme is modelled in MATLAB simulink environment. The simulation results show that the PSO based tuning provide less overshoot, ripples in the DC-link voltage and lesser settling time as compared to convention PI tuning.  REFERENCES:  S. Adamu, H.

http://asokatechnologies.in/filterless-single-phase-ac-ac-converter-based-coupled-inductors-safe-commutation-strategy-continuous-input-current-2/,"2017, IEEE ABSTRACT: A novel single phase ac-ac converter with no LC input/output filters is presented in this paper. The proposed converter has all the advantages of the previous single phase impedance source ac-ac converters; it can operate in buck/boost and in-phase/out-of phase with the input voltage, that makes it appropriate for voltage sags/swells compensator without any dc storage. A coupled transformer based on T-structure is utilized to give an opportunity to access desired output voltage with various duty cycles. In this topology snubber circuit is not required, because a safe commutation strategy enables to eliminate voltage and current spikes produced by short-circuit path. In addition, the converter performs in continuous current mode, so there is no inrush current. Also, the characteristic which the output voltage reverses or maintains phase angle with the input voltage is supported well, because the input and output share the same ground. Eventually, circuit analysis, operating principles and simulation results in MATLAB/SIMULINK are presented to verify the performance of the converter.

Simulation results of the proposed converter in buck out-of-phase mode at D = 0.2, R=10 Ω and n = 2, input/output voltage, output current CONCLUSION: In this study, a single phase T-source ac-ac converter has been introduced. The novel topology operates in continuous current mode and low THD, with no filters in input and output. With consider of this point, some privileges rise up such as declining in size and reducing in cost of the converter. Also, output voltage enables to reverse or sustain the phase angle relevant to input voltage greatly, because of the common ground. In addition, a safe commutation strategy is usedto prevent appearance of voltage spikes and current spikes, so it leads to the converter could be designed without any snubber circuits in bidirectional switches. The presence of a coupled transformer based on T- structure in the topology gives this permission to converter that operates in a wider range of duty cycles control. Furthermore, by using of T-source in this topology, desirable voltage gain has been obtained in small conducting duration, which leads to increase efficiency and decrease losses considerably. Moreover, this converter can be applied for DVR devices with utilizing buck-boost feature to compensate various voltage sags and voltage swells. Eventually, accuracy performance and theoretical results of the converter have been verified with consequences of the simulation. REFERENCES: [1] X. Liu, P.Wang, P. C. Loh, and F.

http://asokatechnologies.in/adaptive-pr-controller/,"ABSTRACT: In recent years, there has been a rapid increase in the number of grid connected three phase inverter systems being connected to the distribution network. As a result, the need for high quality, low harmonic distortion, and current injection into the grid is essential. To achieve this, careful consideration of the inverter controller is necessary. Many control methods are based on the traditional proportional-integral controller (PI), or the more recently adopted Proportional Resonant controller (PR). This paper presents a new technique of minimizing the error of the current control in a three phase grid connected inverter using a readily implementable Adaptive Proportional Resonance controller. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique.   KEYWORDS:  Proportional Resonant Grid- connected Inverter LCL filter.    SOFTWARE: MATLAB/SIMULINK   BLOCK DIAGRAM:   Fig 1 Adaptive PR controller in stationary reference control    EXPECTED SIMULATION RESULTS:    Fig.2 Simulation result waveforms.

In addition, the adaptive PR controller offers superior output power regulation, and improved power quality performance. Overall, it can be concluded that the adaptive PR controller is better suited in the event of grid faults, or operation in weak grid environments, compared to fix gain controllers.   REFERENCES:  Wuhua and H.

http://asokatechnologies.in/pulse-width-modulated-voltage-source-inverter/,"ABSTRACT  The development of power electronics technology gives ample of opportunity for the grid integration of renewable in an efficient way. Commonly pulse width modulated voltage source inverter is widely used for this purpose. The control technique of grid integrated inverters plays a major role for the reduction of harmonic and improvement of power quality in the system. The most commonly used current control technique for the control of the inverter is hysteresis current controller strategies. But the main drawback hysteresis current controller is the uneven switching frequency and higher harmonic distortion. In this paper a hysteresis current controller with offset band for three phase grid integrated pulse width modulated voltage source inverter has been implemented for considerable reduction of harmonic distortion and better power quality. The MATLAB-Simulink environment is used to model, study and simulate the system.

THD for HCC with offset band CONCLUSION  The HCC with offset scheme is implemented to achieve lower THD and power quality improvement of the three phase grid connected PWM-VSI. The result obtained from simulation is compared with HCC system. The result reveals that the HCC with offset scheme has lower THD i.e. 2.10% as compared to HCC which is 3.22% and also the average switching frequency is less due to the zero level in the inverter output voltage. The another advantage of HCC with offset scheme is, average value of the current error is smaller as compared to HCC which can be verified by comparing the result of current error of both the schemes. It implies the power quality is superior in case of HCC with offset band.   REFERENCES   Falk, ,  “Prolog   to   renewable   energy   today   and   tomorrow,”  in Proceedings of the IEEE , vol.89, no.8, pp.1214-1215, Aug. 2001 Kroposki, B.; Pink, C.; DeBlasio, R.; Thomas, H.; Simões, M.; Sen, P.K., “Benefits of Power Electronic Interfaces for Distributed Energy Systems,” IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, , vol.25, no.3, pp.901-908, Sept.

http://asokatechnologies.in/single-stage-utility-scale/,"IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL, VOL. 11, NO. 3, SEPTEMBER 2015 ABSTRACT: For utility-scale photovoltaic (PV) systems, the control objectives, such as maximum power point tracking, synchronization with grid, current control, and harmonic reduction in output current, are realized in single stage for high efficiency and simple power converter topology. This paper considers a highpower three-phase single-stage PV system, which is connected to a distribution network, with a modified control strategy, which includes compensation for grid voltage dip and reactive power injection capability. To regulate the dc-link voltage, a modified voltage controller using feedback linearization scheme with feedforward PV current signal is presented. The real and reactive powers are controlled by using dq components of the grid current. A small-signal stability/eigenvalue analysis of a grid-connected PV system with the complete linearized model is performed to assess the robustness of the controller and the decoupling character of the grid-connected PV system. The dynamic performance is evaluated on a real-time digital simulator.   KEYWORDS:  DC-link voltage control Feedback linearization (FBL) Photovoltaic (PV) systems Reactive power control Small signal stability analysis Voltage dip.

Small-signal analysis of a PV system connected to an IEEE 33-bus distributed system is performed. The results from simulation and eigenvalue analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of the FBL controller compared with the controller without FBL. It is found that the FBL controller  outperforms the controllerwithout FBL, as the FBL controller’s  performance is linear at different operating conditions. With grid voltage dip compensator filter, the dynamic performance is much improved in terms of less oscillations and distortion in waveforms. In addition, the eigenvalue analysis shows that the effect of the disturbance in distribution system is negligible on PV system stability as the eigenmodes of the PV system are almost independent of the distribution system. This has been also confirmed by three-phase fault analysis of distribution system in RTDS model. The controller performance is also validated on 4×375 kW PV units connected to the distribution system.   REFERENCES:  Oprisan and S.

http://asokatechnologies.in/railway-traction-drives/,"ABSTRACT:   For railway traction drives, the dynamic front end typically receives a separate stage rectifier. Be that as it may, the dc-combine voltage of this single-stage rectifier contains a second-arrange change part because of the variance of the immediate power at both the air conditioner and dc sides. Encouraged by the change dc-interface voltage, the footing engine experiences serious torque and current pulse. The equipment arrangement with an extra LC booming channel is basic, yet it will lessen the power thickness of the framework. Railway Traction Drives An optional arrangement is to wipe out the beat part in the stat-or voltage/current through adjust proportion or frequency payment. Notwithstanding, it is hard to accomplish superior for the customary feed forward technique. In this paper, an enhanced shut circle torque and current throb hiding technique is proposed, and which can wipe out the q-pivot current throb part in the field-arranged control framework through recurrence pay. The torque throb concealment is additionally accomplished consequently. Recreation and test results demonstrate that the proposed plan can successfully lessen the torque and current throb in different activity modes contrasted and the ordinary feed-forward strategy.

CONCLUSION: A closed-loop torque and current pulsation suppression method for railway traction drives under fluctuating dc-link voltage is proposed. This method aims to eliminate the q-axis current pulsation component in the F O C system through output frequency compensation. The torque pulsation suppression is achieved on the basis of q-axis current pulsation elimination automatically. A resonant controller is proposed for the closed loop control of q-axis current and dynamic compensation of the output frequency. Different from the conventional feed forward open-loop frequency compensation method, the torque pulsation with the proposed method is suppressed through the elimination of the q-axis current pulsation component rather than the beat component in the output voltage. Proposed method The effectiveness of the proposed method have been verified by simulation and experiments on traction drives with the invert er operated in asynchronous, synchronous, and square wave modulation modes, respectively. The results have been compared to those with the conventional feed forward frequency compensation method based on fluctuating dc-link voltage detection. Both simulation and experimental results show that the suppression of stator current and torque pulsation are obvious in different modulation modes with the proposed control method using the same dc-link capacitance. The proposed suppression method can reduce the sensitivity of the system to variations of the grid frequency. However, the fluctuating component in the dc-link voltage will be increased with the proposed method compared with the LC resonant filter solution. REFERENCES: [1] R. J.

The DC link voltage is controlled by PI controller, which when optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization Technique further reduces the THD value of source current. The values of THD in phase a, b and c of source current are 30.18%, 31.54%, 31.74% respectively. Further it is analyzed that by optimizing the gains of PI controller the THD values are further reduced from 2.66% to 1.85% for 􀍲􀍲firing angle. Thus we can clearly state that optimization of PI controller using PSO further reduces the harmonics on the source side.   REFERENCES: [1] M.H.J.

http://asokatechnologies.in/hysteresis-current-controller/,"ABSTRACT: This paper proposes a dual-bridge (DB) LLC resonant converter for wide input applications. The topology is an integration of a half-bridge (HB) LLC circuit and a full-bridge (FB) LLC circuit. The fixed-frequency pulse width-modulated (PWM) control is employed and a range of twice the minimum input voltage can be covered. Compared with the traditional pulse frequency modulation (PFM) controlled HB/FB LLC resonant converter, the voltage gain range is independent of the quality factor, and the magnetizing inductor has little influence on the voltage gain, which can simplify the parameter selection process and benefit the design of magnetic components as well. Over the full load range, zero-voltage switching (ZVS) and zero-current switching (ZCS) can be achieved for primary switches and secondary rectifier diodes, respectively. Detailed analysis on the modulation schedule and operating principle of the proposed converter is presented along with the converter performance. Finally, all theoretical analysis and characteristics are verified by experimental results from a 120-V to 240-V input 24 V/20 A output converter prototype.

CONCLUSION:  A fixed-frequency-controlled DB LLC resonant converter with a wide input range has been proposed in this paper. In the proposed DBLLC resonant converter, two operating modes (HB and FB modes) are identified and utilized to regulate the output voltage within a wide input voltage range. The modulation strategy, operating principle and characteristics are investigated in depth. Compared with a conventional PFM-controlled LLC converter, the proposed DB LLC resonant converter adopts the fixed-frequency PWM control. The voltage gain range is independent of the quality factor Q and the magnetizing inductance has little impact on the dc voltage gain characteristics. Thus, the process of parameter design can be simplified and also a larger inductor ratio can be chosen to reduce the conduction loss. The structure and control strategy of the DB LLC resonant converter are simpler compared with conventional fixed-frequency TL LLC resonant converters. The performance of the proposed DB LLC resonant converter is experimentally verified on a 120–240 V input 24 V/20 A output converter prototype. All primary-side switches operate with ZVS and secondary-side diodes turn off with ZCS within wide input voltage and full-load ranges. Also, good dynamic performance with respect to input variations and load changes can be achieved under the closed-loop control. Therefore, the DB LLC resonant converter is a good candidate for wide input voltage applications.  REFERENCES:   [1] M.M. Jovanovi´c and B. T.

http://asokatechnologies.in/mtech-power-systems-projects-2/,"ABSTRACT: Induction motor (IM) is the workhorse of the industries. Amongst various speed control schemes for IM, variable-voltage variable-frequency (VVVF) is popularly used. Inverters are broadly used to produce variable/controlled frequency and variable/controlled output voltage for various applications like ac machine drives, switched mode power supply (SMPS), uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), etc. This paper presents the two-fold solution of control for such loads. In this novel solution, rms values of output voltage is varied by controlling the inverter duty ratio which operates as an ac chopper, while the fundamental frequency of output voltage is varied by controlling the buck-boost converter according to the reference frequency given to it. The buck-boost converter shuffles between buck-mode and boost-mode to produce required frequency by generating the modulated dc-link for the inverter, unlike conventional fixed dc-link in case of ac-dc-ac converters. The proposed technique eliminates over modulation (as in conventional pulse width modulated inverters) and hence the non-linearity, and lower order harmonics are absent. Further, it reduces dv/dt in the output voltage resulting less stress on the insulation of machine winding, and electromagnetic interference. However, the proposed scheme demands more number of power semiconductor devices as compared to their conventional ac-dc ac counterparts. Simulation studies of proposed single-phase as well as three-phase topologies are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink. Hardware implementation of proposed single-phase topology is done using dSPACE DS1104 R&D controller board and results are presented.

Fig. 5 Simulation result of proposed three-phase topology. CONCLUSION: Relation between fundamental output voltage (rms) and duty ratio of switches of ac chopper operating as inverter is linear. So, on increasing the duty ratio of pulses given to switches, output voltage of inverter increases linearly. To get 100 % inverter output voltage, no need to go in over modulation region, which eliminates the non-linearity. The profile of output voltage of inverter (with chopping depending on the duty ratio of its switches) is sinusoidal because of modulated dc-link provided by the buck-boost converter, which reduces lower order harmonics, and %THD. It also reduces dv/dt as envelope of output voltage is sinusoidal as full dc-link voltage is not switched. This reduction in dv/dt reduces the stresses on the enameled copper wire of the stator winding of the motor. It will reduce the inter-turn short circuit failure of stator winding. Also this reduction of dv/dt will reduce the electromagnetic interference generated by the inverter in the drive system. In the proposed scheme, output voltage of buck-boost converter follows the reference voltage very closely for different frequencies, so when reference voltage is greater than input voltage, converter has to operate in boost mode else operates in buck mode. Hardware implementation of proposed single phase scheme is carried out. The hardware results have very close resemblance with the simulation results. The proposed concept is novel, and with appropriate refinements, can offer new era of control of inverter for V/f three-phase induction motor drive applications. However, it demands more number of power semiconductor devices compared to that needed for the conventional ac-dc-ac approach.

It compensates both the voltage sag and swell when used as a dynamic voltage restorer. Its basic switching cell is a unidirectional buck circuit, owing to which it has no shoot-through concerns. It achieves safe commutation without using RC snubbers or soft commutation strategies. Further, it can be implemented with power MOSFETs without their body diodes conducting, and for current freewheeling external diodes of good reverse recovery features can be used to minimize the reverse recovery issues and relevant loss. The detailed theoretical analysis and experimental results of a 300-W prototype converter are provided. dual-buck   KEYWORDS:  AC–AC converter Bipolar voltage gain Commutation Dual-buck DVR MOSFET    SOFTWARE: MATLAB/SIMULINK CIRCUIT DIAGRAM:  Fig 1: Proposed buck-boost ac-ac converter   EXPECTED SIMULATION RESULTS:  Fig.2.

It combined the operations of non-inverting buck and inverting buck-boost converters in one structure. Similar to the buck converter, it has a non-inverting buck operation, and similar to an inverting buck-boost converter, it has an inverting buck-boost operation. In addition, it has an extra operation, in which the output voltage higher or lower than the input voltage that is in-phase or out-of-phase with the input voltage can be obtained. Thus, the proposed converter can compensate both voltage sag and swell when used in a DVR. The basic unit of the proposed converter is a unidirectional buck circuit, therefore it has no short-circuit and open-circuit problems. It has no commutation problems, and does not require lossy snubbers and/or soft commutation strategies for operation. Further, it can utilize MOSFETs without their body diodes conducting and without reverse recovery issues and relevant losses. A detailed analysis of the proposed converter and DVR has been presented and validated by experimental results.   REFERENCES:  E. Brumsickle, R. S. Schneider, G. A. Luckjiff, D. M. Divan, and M. F.

One of the most important applications of BESS is to restore an electric power system to operation without counting on the external transmission network. To prevent potential damage to the expensive equipment of power plant, the converters must generate a high quality and reliable three phase voltage. This research provides a simulation-based investigation in order to scrutinize different multi-level inverter topologies to find the more appropriate multi-level inverter structure for BESS application. The investigation has been done entitled of quantitative and qualitative studies. Throughout the quantitative study, the output specifications of each inverter topology is scrutinized, while other features such as reliability, modularity and functionality are scrutinized as qualitative study. All topologies are simulated in MATLAB/Simulink at the same operating conditions.

The investigation has been done entitled of quantitative and qualitative studies. The important output parameters of inverter topologies were investigated as quantitative study, while other features such as reliability, modularity and functionality were scrutinized in qualitative study. Also, various inverter topologies have been evaluated in terms of required capacity in the same operating point. The simulation results proved that the ideal BESS power conversion system, among reviewed multi-level topologies, is Cascaded topology. This topology was chosen for three reasons. First, the efficiency and reliability studies were conducted, and the CMLI was found to be the most efficient and reliable topology with minimum amount of power loss compared to other topologies. Second, it subdivides the battery string and increases the high voltage functionality. Finally, capacitor volume, cost and THD studies were again confirmed the effectiveness of this topology in battery energy storage systems.   REFERENCES:  Abu-Rub, M. Malinowski, and K.

http://asokatechnologies.in/dual-buck-ac-ac-converter/,"ABSTRACT: This paper proposes “Electric Spring” (ES) based on Single Phase three-level Cascaded H-Bridge Inverter to achieve effective demand side management for stabilizing smart grid fed by substantial intermittent renewable energy sources (RES). Considering the most attractive features of multilevel inverter (MLI), an effective structure of Electric Spring is proposed for suppressing voltage fluctuation in power distribution network arising due to RES and maintaining the critical load voltage. Also, the operation of ES in capacitive as well as inductive mode is discussed. Further, the paper describes droop control method for parallel operation of distributed electric spring for stabilization the power grid. An exclusive dynamic performance of the system using electric spring has been tested and demonstrated through detailed MATLAB simulation.

The implemented Three-level CHMLI based ES for smart grid application effectively regulates the ac mains voltage and reduces the THD content as compared with Two-level VSI based ES. The effectiveness of ES is validated through digital simulation in terms of THD. Lastly simulation results of droop control for Four Electric springs have been implemented in a large-scale distributed pattern in order to make multiple ES act in coordinating manner so as to have robust stabilizing effect.
