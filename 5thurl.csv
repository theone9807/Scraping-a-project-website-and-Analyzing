The proposed BL-CSC converter operating in a discontinuous inductor current mode is used to achieve a unity power factor at the AC mains using a single voltage sensor. The speed of BLDC motor is controlled by varying the DC bus voltage of the voltage source inverter (VSI) feeding BLDC motor via a PFC converter. Therefore, the BLDC motor is electronically commutated such that the VSI operates in fundamental frequency switching for reduced switching losses. Moreover, the bridgeless configuration of CSC converter offers low conduction losses due to partial elimination of diode bridge rectifier at the front end. The proposed configuration shows a considerable increase in efficiency as compared to the conventional scheme. The performance of the proposed drive is validated through experimental results obtained on a developed prototype. Improved power quality is achieved at the AC mains for a wide range of control speeds and supply voltages. The obtained power quality indices are within the acceptable limits of IEC 61000-3-2 KEYWORDS:  BLDC Motor BL-CSC Converter DICM PFC Power Quality  SOFTWARE: MATLAB/SIMULINK CIRCUIT DIAGRAM:   Fig. 1.

CONCLUSION: A PFC based BL-CSC converter fed BLDC motor drive has been proposed with improved power quality at the AC mains. A bridgeless configuration of a CSC converter has been used for achieving reduced conduction losses in PFC converter. The speed control of BLDC motor and power factor correction at AC mains has been achieved using a single voltage sensor. The switching losses in the VSI have been reduced by the use of fundamental frequency switching by electronically commutating the BLDC motor. Moreover, the speed of BLDC motor has been controlled by controlling the DC link voltage of the VSI. The proposed drive has shown an improved power quality at the AC mains for a wide range of speed control and supply voltages.

http://asokatechnologies.in/bldc-motor-drive-landsman-converter/,"IET Power Electronics, 2016  ABSTRACT: This study presents a novel configuration of power factor regulation (PFR)-based Landsman converter feeding a brushless DC motor (BLDCM) drive for low-power (400 W) white goods applications. The speed control of the drive is achieved through adjusting the DC bus voltage of voltage source inverter (VSI) feeding to a BLDCM. Moreover, low frequency switching signals are used for electronic commutation of BLDCM, which reduces the switching power losses of six solid-state switches of VSI. This Landsman converter-based front-end power factor corrector operating in discontinuous inductor current mode is used to control DC bus voltage and PFR is achieved inherently. The DC bus voltage of the drive is controlled by using a single DC voltage sensor. For evaluating the performance of proposed drive, a prototype is developed in the laboratory. The performance of the BLDCM is also analysed for its operation at varying AC mains voltage (90–265 V). Experiential results for power quality indices are found within the limits of power quality standard IEC 61000-3-2.  SOFTWARE: MATLAB/SIMULINK CIRCUIT DIAGRAM:  Fig. 1Circuit configurations of a PFR based Proposed drive scheme of a Landsman converter fed PMBLDCM drive EXPECTED SIMULATION RESULTS:   Fig. 2 Performance of proposed drive at rated torque on motor a Steady-state performance of the proposed BLDCM drive at rated load on BLDCM with DC-link voltage as 200 V and supply voltage as 220 V b–d Obtained power quality indices  Fig. 3 Performance of proposed drive at rated load on motor a Steady-state performance of the proposed BLDCM drive at rated load on BLDCM with DC-link voltage as 60 V and supply voltage as 220 V b–d Obtained power quality indices  Fig. 4 Performance of PFR-based Landsman converter a Input and output inductor’s currents and intermediate capacitor’s waveforms b Current and voltage stress on a PFR switch at rated load on BLDCM at rated condition  Fig. 5 Dynamic performances of the proposed BLDCM drive system during a Starting at 60 V b Speed control for variation in DC bus voltage from 100 to 150 V c Load variation d Supply voltage change from 260 to 210 V CONCLUSION: A PFR-based Landsman converter fed BLDCM drive has been proposed for the use in low power household appliances. Adjustable voltage control of DC bus of VSI has been used to control the speed of BLDCM which eventually has given the freedom to operate the VSI in low frequency switching operation for minimum switching losses. A front-end Landsman converter-based PFR operating in DICM has been applied for double objectives of DC bus voltage control and achieving a UPF at AC supply. Resulted performance for presented drive has been found quite satisfactory for its operation at variation of speed over a wide range. A prototype of Landsman-based BLDCM drive has been implemented with acceptable test results for its operation over complete speed range and its operation over universal AC mains. The stress of the PFR converter switch has been evaluated to conclude its feasibility. The obtained power quality parameters are found within the limit of various international standards like as IEC 61000-3-2.

http://asokatechnologies.in/pwam-controlled-quasi-z-source-motor-drive-2/,"ABSTRACT: This paper proposes a novel pulse-width-amplitude modulation (PWAM) method for three-phase quasi-Z source inverter system in motor drive application. It is demonstrated that it operates at only 1/3 switching frequency of traditional PWM methods, with less harmonic distortion. As a result, switching actions and losses are also reduced significantly. With the proposed modulation, the required capacitance is reduced greatly, which makes a system of smaller volume and lighter weight. Compared to traditional PWM methods, the higher efficiency and better reliability are confirmed in PWAM controlled motor drive system. The motor drive with the proposed hybrid PWAM modulation method presents good performance in simulation. Theoretical analysis is provided to verify the inverter efficiency and design improvements.

The qZSI allows dc-link 6ɷ voltage ripples, as a result that the required qZS inductance and capacitance are reduced significantly. Besides, compared to traditional SPWM, only one third of the switches are doing switching actions, which reduced the number of switching time and loss significantly. By using the proposed PWAM modulation method, the motor drive operates well and efficiently.  REFERENCES: [1] H. W. van der Broeck, H. C. Skudelny, G. V.

http://asokatechnologies.in/commutation-torque-ripple-reduction-bldc-motor-using-modified-sepic-converter-three-level-npc-inverter-3/,"ABSTRACT: This paper presents a new power converter topology to suppress the torque ripple due to the phase current commutation of a brushless DC motor (BLDCM) drive system. A combination of a 3-level diode clamped multilevel inverter (3-level DCMLI), a modified single-ended primary-inductor converter (SEPIC), and a dc-bus voltage selector circuit are employed in the proposed torque ripple suppression circuit. For efficient suppression of torque pulsation, the dc-bus voltage selector circuit is used to apply the regulated dc-bus voltage from the modified SEPIC converter during the commutation interval. In order to further mitigate the torque ripple pulsation, the 3-level DCMLI is used in the proposed circuit. Finally, simulation and experimental results show that the proposed topology is an attractive option to reduce the commutation torque ripple significantly at low and high speed applications.

CONCLUSION: In this paper, a commutation torque ripple reduction circuit has been proposed using 3-level DCMLI with modified SEPIC converter and a dc-bus voltage selector circuit. A laboratory-built drive system has been tested to verify the proposed converter topology. The suggested dc-bus voltage control strategy is more effective in torque ripple reduction in the commutation interval. The proposed topology accomplishes the successful reduction of torque ripple in the commutation period and experimental results are presented to compare the performance of the proposed control technique with the conventional 2-level inverter, 3-level DCMLI, 2-level inverter with SEPIC converter and the switch selection circuit-fed BLDCM. In order to obtain significant torque ripple suppression, quietness and higher efficiency, 3-level DCMLI with modified SEPIC converter and the voltage selector circuit is a most suitable choice to obtain high-performance operation of BLDCM. The proposed topology may be used for the torque ripple suppression of BLDCM with the very low stator winding inductance. REFERENCES: [1] N. Milivojevic, M. Krishnamurthy, Y. Gurkaynak, A.

http://asokatechnologies.in/standalone-photovoltaic-water-pumping-system/,"ABSTRACT A simple and efficient solar photovoltaic (PV) water pumping system utilizing an induction motor drive (IMD) is presented in this paper. This solar PV water pumping system comprises of two stages of power conversion. The first stage extracts the maximum power from a solar PV array by controlling the duty ratio of a DC-DC boost converter. The DC bus voltage is maintained by the controlling the motor speed. This regulation helps in reduction of motor losses because of reduction in motor currents at higher voltage for same power injection. To control the duty ratio, an incremental conductance (INC) based maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control technique is utilized. A scalar controlled voltage source inverter (VSI) serves the purpose of operating an IMD. The stator frequency reference of IMD is generated by the proposed control scheme. The proposed system is modeled and its performance is simulated in detail. The scalar control eliminates the requirement of speed sensor/encoder. Precisely, the need of motor current sensor is also eliminated. Moreover, the dynamics are improved by an additional speed feedforward term in the control scheme. The proposed control scheme makes the system inherently immune to the pump’s constant variation. The prototype of PV powered IMD emulating the pump characteristics, is developed in the laboratory to examine the performance under different operating conditions.   KEYWORDS:  Photovoltaic cells MPPT Water pumping Scalar control Induction motor drives  SOFTWARE:MATLAB/SIMULINK   SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE:  Fig. 1 System architechure for the standalone solar water pumping system    EXPECTED SIMULATION RESULTS:  Fig.2 Starting performance of the proposed system  Fig.3 Steady state and transient behavior of proposed system  Fig.4 Influence of the wrong estimation of pump’s constant  Fig. 5 A brief cost estimation of the proposed solar water pumping system   CONCLUSION The standalone photovoltaic water pumping system with reduced sensor, has been proposed. It utilizes only three sensors. The reference speed generation for V/f control scheme has been proposed based on the available power the regulating the active power at DC bus. The PWM frequency and pump affinity law have been used to control the speed of an induction motor drive. Its feasibility of operation has been verified through simulation and experimental validation. Various performance conditions such as starting, variation in radiation and steady state have been experimentally verified and found to be satisfactory. The main contribution of the proposed control scheme is that it is inherently, immune to the error in estimation of pump’s constant. The system tracks the MPP with acceptable tolerance even at varying radiation.   REFERENCES   Drury, T. Jenkin, D. Jordan, and R.

http://asokatechnologies.in/commutation-torque-ripple-reduction-bldc-motor-using-modified-sepic-converter-three-level-npc-inverter/,"ABSTRACT:  This paper presents a new power converter topology to suppress the torque ripple due to the phase current commutation of a brushless DC motor (BLDCM) drive system. A combination of a 3-level diode clamped multilevel inverter (3-level DCMLI), a modified single-ended primary-inductor converter (SEPIC), and a dc-bus voltage selector circuit are employed in the proposed torque ripple suppression circuit. For efficient suppression of torque pulsation, the dc-bus voltage selector circuit is used to apply the regulated dc-bus voltage from the modified SEPIC converter during the commutation interval. In order to further mitigate the torque ripple pulsation, the 3-level DCMLI is used in the proposed circuit. Finally, simulation and experimental results show that the proposed topology is an attractive option to reduce the commutation torque ripple significantly at low and high speed applications.

http://asokatechnologies.in/mtech-power-electronics-projects/,"2017, IEEE ABSTRACT: In this paper a novel position sensorless scheme named Back EMF Zero Difference Point (ZDP) detection has been proposed for six-switch VSI converter fed permanent magnet BLDC motor. This technique is based on the comparison of back EMFs and detection of the points in the back EMF waveforms where they cross each other or in other words they are equal. Commutation point is achieved exactly at the same instant when the difference of back EMFs of any two phases becomes zero. The simulation study has been carried out for the proposed sensorless scheme. The proposed sensorless scheme has the excellent performance from zero to the extra high speed. The method needs no additional delay circuit as used for calculation of commutation point from back EMF ZCP and involves less calculation burden. The method is fault tolerant and accurate even in the case of noise in measurement (or estimation) of phase back EMFs. A nonzero threshold value proportional to input voltage (or reference speed) is used for overcoming the problem due to quantization and sampling for digital implementation. This method proves to be excellent substitute of hall sensing scheme as it also senses at zero speed. KEYWORDS:  BLDC motor Back EMF ZDP Commutation Sensorless control Zero difference point.   SOFTWARE: MATLAB/SIMULINK BLOCK DIAGRAM:  Fig.1 VSI fed BLDC motor with indirect Back EMF detection scheme EXPECTED SIMULATION RESULTS:  Fig.2.

Fig.6. sensing fault occurs at 0.5 second in the measurement of phase-B back EMF.  Fig.7. speed increases when sensing fault occurs (here phase-B sensing fault CONCLUSION: In the proposed Back EMF Zero Difference Point (ZDP) detection method, the very first commutation signal is achieved at starting itself i.e. one step before the ZCP method, which proves the superiority of the method. The back EMF for the proposed scheme can be applied to various existing back EMF detection or estimation techniques. This technique is insensitive to the inherent noise in measurement (or estimation) of back EMF. This method does not need extra Circuitry as needed for delay after ZCP for getting commutation point, thereby less computational complexity is involved. The speed (or input voltage) proportional threshold used for avoiding uncertainty in the zero difference of back EMF, sets its scope of wide usability in precise operation from zero to extra high speed. Operation at initial zero back EMF is the main strength of this method and it doesn’t necessitate separate starting techniques. Speed response at transient period is 0.15 ms faster than previous methods for identical motor parameters.

Conventionally, the speed is measured using precision speed encoders. Since these encoders cost almost half of the entire drive system, there arises the need for a low cost speed estimation technique. This is proposed by measuring the frequency of the in-built-hall sensor signals. Here, a closed loop speed control of BLDC motor is proposed using a current controlled pulse width modulation (PWM) technique. Since BLDC motor is an electronically commutated machine, the commutation period is determined by a switching table that shows the hall signals’ status. The entire system was simulated in MATLAB/Simulink and the performance of the system was analyzed for different speed and torque references.  KEYWORDS:  Brushless DC Motor (BLDC) Speed estimation Hall sensors Current controlled PWM Inverter   SOFTWARE: MATLAB/SIMULINK BLOCK DIAGRAM:  Fig.1.

This method was found to be working for the entire range of speeds below the rated speed. The performance of the system was comparable with that of the conventional speed encoder based control technique. Actual speed was found to maintain the reference speed for different values of load torques. This was verified successfully by using MATLAB/Simulink. Since the proposed speed estimation technique does not require the motor parameters like resistance, inductance etc., the system is suitable for robust applications, especially in industries. The future scope of the work can be extended as explained below:  Although the work emphasizes on speed encoder-less control technique, the cost of the system can be further reduced by replacing the hall sensors with a suitable low cost counterpart. Since the torque-ripples are found to be appreciably high, novel techniques for its reduction can be studied.
