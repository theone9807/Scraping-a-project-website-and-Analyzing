5,http://1000projects.org/loss-control-system-for-insurance-producers-net-project.html,loss control system for insurance producers net project.," Introduction Insurance companies issue various types of policies to protect home and business owners from various types of unforeseen calamities such as fire, floods, theft etc.  However, prior to issuing or renewing a policy, the insurance company conducts a field survey of the property to ensure that the property is adequately secured and is not vulnerable to damage.  Thus the insurance company ensures that the chances of damage or loss are controlled.  For example, if a petrol pump has to be insured, the petrol pump owner should provide for adequate fire safety equipment, signboards prohibiting smoking near the fueling area etc. In order to conduct these surveys, the insurance company enlists the services of independent surveyors residing near the property.  These surveyors are trained personnel and are pre-approved for certain types of activities.  The aim of the project is to develop a system used by insurance companies and surveyors to record the surveys to be done, assigning a surveyor to conduct the survey, capture, and approval of survey results, recording and approving of the surveyor’s Time and Expenses (T&E) Report.            Workflow of the proposed system  Detailed Functionality   1.    Record the Surveys to be done Prior to issuing or renewing an insurance policy, the underwriting department raises an RFS (Request for Service) in LCS.  The details to be entered include – Location to be surveyed Type of insurance coverage (fire, theft, flood etc.) Date by which the survey should be completed Surveyor ID  (to be searched based on the location’s pin code) Type of service requested (eg. Survey.  In future, the same system can be extended to verify insurance claims) The estimated budget for the survey (This is the amount of money that the insurance company is willing to spend towards surveyor’s T & E) The underwriter may also attach a copy of insurance policy application to RFS.   Working with an RFS   Once an RFS is assigned to a surveyor, he/she starts working on the RFS.  The surveyor should be able to query the status of various RFS’s assigned to him/her.  Typical activities that are carried out by Surveyor on RFS include – Scheduling a visit to the location – Enter the scheduled date and time in the system and update the status. Survey the location and Write a Survey report – Attach the survey report to RFS on completing the site visit. Writing recommendations and following-up on recommendations – Writes recommendations on the corrective actions to be taken at the location and updating the action taken on the recommendation. Entering time and expense details – Record the time and expenses incurred to carry out the survey and the follow-up actions.  These details have to be entered by date and activity. Close RFS – After all the details are entered, the surveyor closes the RFS.   Approving Time and Expenses   The underwriter reviews the T&E reports and either approves or disapproves the expenses based on the budget. In case it is disapproved, he/she cites the reasons for disapproval.  The surveyor is informed to update the expenses accordingly. If it is approved, it is sent to the finance section for payment.   Reporting   This module generates various reports for surveyors and underwriters. For surveyors –  List of RFS by status,  List of RFS received or completed during a given period, Report on T & E for a given period For underwriters – List of RFS by status (across surveyors or for a specific surveyor), List of RFS raised or completed during a given period,   T&E claimed and paid during a given period.

8,http://1000projects.org/crystal-market-e-kart-web-portal-project.html,crystal market e kart web portal project.," Abstract This concept basically related to a portal which will allow dealers or vendors and customer linking on a common platform. This portal will be a web platform wherein vendor will register and add crystal products. They can also differentiate and highlight special crystals as per horoscope ( as they have a huge market). Once crystals are added they will be available for sale which can be searched and added to kart by customers for buying. Portal will provide an easy to use and responsive website.  Project Description in Brief:  The requirement will be to develop an admin module which will be used to sell products, register vendors, register customers, cart functionality and related crystals functionality. We can also manage coupons from admin panel. This will also involve web service / API which will communicate with Website front end and database and save data securely via admin panel.  We will also have employee management wherein executives delivering the sold products to customers will be registered and in turn, will track the delivery part. The application will involve order management and delivery. This will involve executive, the order created and tracking id.  The application will have an informational part too like About US, Terms & conditions, Privacy policy etc which basically will be static pages.  User Types: Admin, Customer, Employee logins (no vendor login as discussed)            Admin will have access to all modules in the web and can monitor everything in the application. Customer / Buyer will have access to crystal products view and can browse through and access offers and then finally add products to the kart and order the same. The employee is basically the delivery executive login who will actually manage the deliveries and will have access to the related delivery management screens only Vendor / Seller is basically related to sellers who will register themselves, add their products to the admin panel and the added products will be marketed via the website.   Modules:  Users Modules: Will involve login, registration and log out as the basic functionalities. Users will also have My basket functionality to manage the crystal products added to the kart. My orders will deal with the story of transactions and orders for a logged in and registered customer. My profile will have edit, delivery address manage option, change the password and other details that are necessary.  Admin Panel: Admin being an important module will manage delivery executive employees and their delivery history as it will be linked to order and delivery management. Customers also will be managed by the admin panel. Vendors will register to the application and we can manage vendors via admin panel. Registered vendors will be able to add their products which will be advertised for sale in the crystal market portal. Admin will most importantly manage the categories and subcategories that are involved in adding products and then their sales via the portal. It will also manage the filters that will be provided for searching for various types of crystals.  Kart Module: This Module actually will handle the addition of crystal products which are anticipated to be ordered by a viable customer.  It will be then linked to order management and delivery tracking.  Delivery / Order tracking: It will basically show which order is linked to a particular executive as admin will assign it to a particular executive. Complete delivery status can be tracked in this module. As per order management is concerned once a product is confirmed in kart it will be transferred to order tracking as an order id is assigned to it. And then a delivery executive is assigned an order. This workflow actually provides a flexible tracking system. Future Enhancements:  We can come up with SMS alerts for delivery tracking and registration messages. We can provide reports module with a different type of reports for admin login related to sales, order and delivery reports.  We can also introduce a comprehensive invoice module too. Add coupon management system via admin panel   Technology to Use  HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript & jQuery for markup, design and interaction behavior Bootstrap / Angular JS will be used for making the site responsive and as a framework.

25,http://1000projects.org/loss-control-system-for-insurance-producers-net-project.html,loss control system for insurance producers net project.," Introduction Insurance companies issue various types of policies to protect home and business owners from various types of unforeseen calamities such as fire, floods, theft etc.  However, prior to issuing or renewing a policy, the insurance company conducts a field survey of the property to ensure that the property is adequately secured and is not vulnerable to damage.  Thus the insurance company ensures that the chances of damage or loss are controlled.  For example, if a petrol pump has to be insured, the petrol pump owner should provide for adequate fire safety equipment, signboards prohibiting smoking near the fueling area etc. In order to conduct these surveys, the insurance company enlists the services of independent surveyors residing near the property.  These surveyors are trained personnel and are pre-approved for certain types of activities.  The aim of the project is to develop a system used by insurance companies and surveyors to record the surveys to be done, assigning a surveyor to conduct the survey, capture, and approval of survey results, recording and approving of the surveyor’s Time and Expenses (T&E) Report.            Workflow of the proposed system  Detailed Functionality   1.    Record the Surveys to be done Prior to issuing or renewing an insurance policy, the underwriting department raises an RFS (Request for Service) in LCS.  The details to be entered include – Location to be surveyed Type of insurance coverage (fire, theft, flood etc.) Date by which the survey should be completed Surveyor ID  (to be searched based on the location’s pin code) Type of service requested (eg. Survey.  In future, the same system can be extended to verify insurance claims) The estimated budget for the survey (This is the amount of money that the insurance company is willing to spend towards surveyor’s T & E) The underwriter may also attach a copy of insurance policy application to RFS.   Working with an RFS   Once an RFS is assigned to a surveyor, he/she starts working on the RFS.  The surveyor should be able to query the status of various RFS’s assigned to him/her.  Typical activities that are carried out by Surveyor on RFS include – Scheduling a visit to the location – Enter the scheduled date and time in the system and update the status. Survey the location and Write a Survey report – Attach the survey report to RFS on completing the site visit. Writing recommendations and following-up on recommendations – Writes recommendations on the corrective actions to be taken at the location and updating the action taken on the recommendation. Entering time and expense details – Record the time and expenses incurred to carry out the survey and the follow-up actions.  These details have to be entered by date and activity. Close RFS – After all the details are entered, the surveyor closes the RFS.   Approving Time and Expenses   The underwriter reviews the T&E reports and either approves or disapproves the expenses based on the budget. In case it is disapproved, he/she cites the reasons for disapproval.  The surveyor is informed to update the expenses accordingly. If it is approved, it is sent to the finance section for payment.   Reporting   This module generates various reports for surveyors and underwriters. For surveyors –  List of RFS by status,  List of RFS received or completed during a given period, Report on T & E for a given period For underwriters – List of RFS by status (across surveyors or for a specific surveyor), List of RFS raised or completed during a given period,   T&E claimed and paid during a given period.

This portal will be a web platform wherein vendor will register and add crystal products. They can also differentiate and highlight special crystals as per horoscope ( as they have a huge market). Once crystals are added they will be available for sale which can be searched and added to kart by customers for buying. Portal will provide an easy to use and responsive website.  Project Description in Brief:  The requirement will be to develop an admin module which will be used to sell products, register vendors, register customers, cart functionality and related crystals functionality. We can also manage coupons from admin panel. This will also involve web service / API which will communicate with Website front end and database and save data securely via admin panel.  We will also have employee management wherein executives delivering the sold products to customers will be registered and in turn, will track the delivery part. The application will involve order management and delivery. This will involve executive, the order created and tracking id.  The application will have an informational part too like About US, Terms & conditions, Privacy policy etc which basically will be static pages.  User Types: Admin, Customer, Employee logins (no vendor login as discussed)            Admin will have access to all modules in the web and can monitor everything in the application. Customer / Buyer will have access to crystal products view and can browse through and access offers and then finally add products to the kart and order the same. The employee is basically the delivery executive login who will actually manage the deliveries and will have access to the related delivery management screens only Vendor / Seller is basically related to sellers who will register themselves, add their products to the admin panel and the added products will be marketed via the website.   Modules:  Users Modules: Will involve login, registration and log out as the basic functionalities. Users will also have My basket functionality to manage the crystal products added to the kart. My orders will deal with the story of transactions and orders for a logged in and registered customer. My profile will have edit, delivery address manage option, change the password and other details that are necessary.  Admin Panel: Admin being an important module will manage delivery executive employees and their delivery history as it will be linked to order and delivery management. Customers also will be managed by the admin panel. Vendors will register to the application and we can manage vendors via admin panel. Registered vendors will be able to add their products which will be advertised for sale in the crystal market portal. Admin will most importantly manage the categories and subcategories that are involved in adding products and then their sales via the portal. It will also manage the filters that will be provided for searching for various types of crystals.  Kart Module: This Module actually will handle the addition of crystal products which are anticipated to be ordered by a viable customer.  It will be then linked to order management and delivery tracking.  Delivery / Order tracking: It will basically show which order is linked to a particular executive as admin will assign it to a particular executive. Complete delivery status can be tracked in this module. As per order management is concerned once a product is confirmed in kart it will be transferred to order tracking as an order id is assigned to it. And then a delivery executive is assigned an order. This workflow actually provides a flexible tracking system. Future Enhancements:  We can come up with SMS alerts for delivery tracking and registration messages. We can provide reports module with a different type of reports for admin login related to sales, order and delivery reports.  We can also introduce a comprehensive invoice module too. Add coupon management system via admin panel   Technology to Use  HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript & jQuery for markup, design and interaction behavior Bootstrap / Angular JS will be used for making the site responsive and as a framework.

The system doesn’t understand sharing files among all range of system IP address. There is no interface designed to search the files on a specific LAN. High-level views of the system network activity are not provided by the existing system. In applications ranging from financial institutions to manufacturing facilities, network engineers will find Serial test easy to work with but loaded with features.           SOLUTION OF THESE PROBLEMS In the proposed system workgroup will be populated in the interface completely, by using this workgroup the only administrator will know the architecture of the LAN. The proposed system is a passive and easy-to-use network monitor that helps network personnel understand what is occurring on their communications LANs. By observing the workgroup range administrator will arrange the IP address range in the proposed system. A high-level view of the system network activity is provided in this proposed system. A good user interface will provide the administrator to watch the network sharing files among the LAN. Whenever a file is transferring between a range of IP addresses, the administrator can watch the file content on its own file mode.

Basically, in our project we will come up with an online auction system wherein the products can be added to the system and they will be provided with needed details that are needed for being placed in the bidding process. Once a product or good is added to the system, the system will approve them via admin and then allowed for bidding. Bids will be accepted from different customers and whoever gets the highest bid will be buying the product. Each product that has been allowed or placed for bidding will have an initial start bid price and no customer can bid a price less than that. A specified quantity of product will also be provided. The timeframe for which a product will be open for bidding will also be provided at the time of adding the product and after that customers cannot bid for it.           Auctions basically can also be like vocational process too wherein people say their prices and there will be a bidder calling the prices in an event organized specifically for certain products. But our system will allow a secured process where transactions will be done online and final sales price for a sold product can be known only when it is done with bidding.  User Types: Admin Customers Vendors Admin: Admin will approve a customer who can place bids. He can also approve a vendor who will register the product in the application which is placed for bidding. Admin can see all info related to bids that have been placed on any product and approve the highest bid and declare the customer who has won the bidding. Admin is the one who will have access to admin panel. Customers: They will register themselves to place bids and purchase products. A registered customer can view his transactions and bids that he or she has placed. He or she can update his or her profile info too after getting registered. Vendors: They will register and also add the products that are to be placed for bidding and then sold to a customer whoever bids the highest in bidding.  vendors registration has to be confirmed by admin and then only can log in to the application and then will have the option to add the products. Add products will be provided with info like minimum bid price, bid end date, bid start date, a picture of the product to be bidded. The vendor will also have the option to view the bids that have been received for his or her products, the option will be there to edit the profile. Bid: This module is the main module for this application and it is basically the heart of this system, we may need a web service for this app. As per feasibility is concerned we will have n number of customers logged in for an online bidding process. Logged In customers are basically the registered customers who are basically approved by an admin to participate in the bidding. this module will have the option to show Picture of the embedded product, Start price of the product, Quantity, Bid start date, Bid end date, Enter Bid price and submit. These options will be available for each customer whoever is logged in for bidding for a particular product. we can come up with a concurrent bidding system where n number of customers can place biddings at a specified timeframe or allow only a certain number of customers to place bidding. Admin panel: This module is an important module wherein products will be added to the system and also be managed. Products can be added to the system via vendors. Each vendor will be allowed to add a product after being registered and approved to showcase their products in the auction. Admin panel will have options to view the products saved by vendors. This module will allow management of added customers and vendors also. Whenever a vendor registers it is saved to the database via admin panel. Similarly, customer registration info will be saved to the application via admin panel. It actually provides an efficient way of saving the data and managing it.  Existing System The transaction between the buyer and the seller was being carried out conventionally where everyone will gather and shout out their bidding prices and this actually is not secure and a tedious way of bidding for products.  This process will also be affected by influences of personalities from bigger societies. One of the concepts that the online auctions were started with was the idea that people could police themselves, but those with the intent to take advantage of others have found the means to bypass this mild safeguard as well.  It was envisioned that with the opportunity to give ‘feedback’ on each other as buyers and sellers, honesty would remain intact.  However, some have found a way to inflate their ratings which makes them appear trustworthy to do business with.

60,http://1000projects.org/online-terminal-management-system-net-project.html,online terminal management system net project.," The Online Terminal Management System project contains five modules. Those modules are MODULES:  Master Transaction Store-rent Planning Administration  Master:            Two tables are used: Master Table: In this module the details of the vessel, vessel operator, port master, MLO master, cha master, and exim tariff. The vessel details are vessel code, vessel name, vessel voyage number, vessel length on average (loa), vessel from port, vessel to port, vessel capacity, actual time of berthing (atb), actual time of unberthing, expected time of berthing, expected time of unberthing. The vessel operator details are vsl opr code, vsl opr name, address1, address2, city, phone no., fax no., e-mail, and contact person. The details of port master are port code, port name, and country. The details of MLO master are MLO code, MLO name, address1, address2, city, phone no., fax no., e-mail, and contact person. The cha master details are cha code, cha name, address1, address2, city, phone no., fax no., e-mail, and contact person. The Exim tariff contains the details of the container such as container size, container status, and price. Transaction Table: In this table the details of EXIM document, container, term gate, store-rent, container operator. The EXIM document contains container-id, cha code, booking date, booking no., MLO code, exim date, exim no., vessel code, amount, cheque no. The container details are container-id, container no., MLO code, container size, container status, container type, container shipping status, container weight, container cargo, shipping bill no., vessel code, and cha code. The term gate contains the details of container-id, gate date$ time, from location to location, truck no. The details in store-rent are container-id, from date& time to date& time, vessel code, total days, rent days, total rent amount. The details of the container are container no., vessel code, shipping status, from location, to location, job confirmation, source port code, dest port code. Store Rent:  Store rent is calculated for the imported containers and containers to be exported. For the imported containers store rent is calculated from the date & time of discharging to the date & time of gate-out. For the containers to be exported store rent is calculated from the date & time of gate-in to the date and time of loading into the vessel. For both the containers the first five days are for free. For each day the rent is 0.75$.  Transaction:  EXIM Document: It contains CHA code, MLO code, container no.,     booking date, booking no., exim no., vessel code, amount, cheque no. Term Gate It contains container no., gate date and time, from location and to location and truck no. Store Rent It contains container no., from and to date & time,   vessel code, total days, rent days and total rent amount. Planning: In this module, two types of planning are involved namely  Yard planning Ship planning  Yard Planning: It is done for the containers to be exported. It is based on the weight of the containers, type of the containers. The containers must be arranged in the form so that it does not lead to any destruction. There are some rules followed such as a container of 40 feet should not be placed above the two containers of each 20 feet.     Ship Planning: It is done for the containers to be imported. It also depends on the weight of the containers, type of the containers. The refer containers must be placed in a separate vessel, if at all some containers are to be placed it should not be placed over the refer containers. The same rules are followed here also as for the yard planning. Administration: Administrator looks after the operations. He creates a report for particular vessel number, MLO, CHA, etc. EXISTING SYSTEM   In existing Terminal Management System the complete process of the shipping is manual. Also the inquiries about the vessel, containers details lead to loss of time. The yard planning takes a lot of time. Sometimes they miss the vessel in which they had to load the containers so it was not reliable also. The details are maintained in large notebooks. Calculating store rents, performing planning are very difficult to be maintained manually. It is very difficult to get the details of a vessel or container by referring a number of large notebooks.The existing system is manual, doesn’t have the flexibility to maintain the whole processes carried out in the office. There are many possibilities for the mistake to take place when the entries or calculations are made manually.The existing system is tedious and time consuming. It also requires handling knowledge and skilled manpower. The maintenance cost with this system is periodical and unavoidable. PROPOSED SYSTEM In proposed Terminal Management System all the operations have been computerized. The vessel details can be viewed through this site. The yard planning can also be done through the site. It saves most of the time and it is more reliable.The terminal management system was developed to fulfill the requirements of the exporters and importers and to reduce their works. The primary task of this system is to relieve the users from his/her complicated works. The development of this system is very much used to extract the details of the vessels or containers by giving their vessel number or container number respectively. The introduction of this system offers substantial benefit. It is possible to maintain accurate and up-to-date records. The system ensures data consistency, data integrity, and data security. Facilities for correcting errors in transaction entry are provided in this system. The proposed system is very much friendly and an easy access to the system.

65,http://1000projects.org/multi-user-contact-management-net-project.html,multi user contact management net project.," Abstract On a daily basis, everyone depends on a lot of contacts which cannot be remembered so easily as it’s tough to do so. Hence dependability increases on phones. What will be the situation if our phone is lost and we do not easily remember our contacts and other important stuff? Idea is to come up with an app which will be a partial remedy to the phone. So let us try an app which will allow saving info like LastName, Firstname, Middlename, Phone number, email id, upload pic etc. It will be multi user application secured as personal data and saved contact details will not be accessible to other users. The other option will be like save notes which will allow user type down anything which can be kept as an info related to passwords or info related to business deals, or info related to id’s or ticket numbers etc.           This Multi-User Contact Manager application will also provide an option to create groups and add contacts in it group wise. The app will also have a feature to create App groups and add friends, like as its a multi-user application known friends can be added to app groups, if a user has created an app he or she will be the admin of the group and send a request to know users in the app. Once added to the group, users will be members of the group and they can post messages in the group like message option will be provided. Contact details of members of a group will be visible to all. No of members added to the group can be seen. No of posts in the group will be seen. Members can post pictures in picture option of a group which will be visible only to the group and its members. Member can also leave the group.  The Multi User Contact Manager app will also have the option to save reminders like birthdays or any marriage function date etc. It will also have the option to save timetable like save different timeframes for different activities. The Multi User Contact Manager app will also have options to see events/groups added by Admin and it is accessible to all registered users. If a group is created by a registered user, it will first be approved and the user who has created a group can send add request to other registered users. Options will be there to log in and log out of the application. This project will have the below logins:  Admin User  Admin: Admin will monitor all groups and posts that are related to the app. Admin has to approve a group started by a registered user and then it can be allowed to send add requests. Admin will also post events or will start any group which will be visible to all registered users. Admin by default will also show all related social contacts and contacts of admins of related groups that are being worked out in the app. Admin can also add pictures of an event and post related postings in the groups that have been created for all users. Admin can also set reminder dates for suppose events and shows notifications or messages in the dashboard so that all registered users can view the same. A common dashboard will be provided which will allow registered user to post any info. Admin will have access to all modules that are developed in this application.

92,http://1000projects.org/three-step-authentication-accessing-atm.html,three step authentication accessing atm.," As we know the current ATM machines that are present do not have a cover on the keypad when trying to access one’s bank account to make a deposit, withdraw cash, transfer money(if available) or check accounts balances. There is also a suggestion on the top of the keypad asking us to cover the keypad when entering the PIN number as this is prone to shoulder-sniffing attack in which the attacker can directly look over a person’s shoulder when entering the PIN number and later steal his/her card and access the bank account. This Three-Step Authentication for accessing ATM project introduces a three-step authentication system to help reduce such attacks which are as follows:           Use of digital scramble keypad: As the name suggests, the keypad for entering the ATM pin will be digital and also the numbers will not be displayed in the usual sequence which prevents any on lookers from deciphering the PIN number. The number sequence changes after every number in the PIN is entered with the help of a random number generator. Color coded combination password: The second step would be to use a color-coded password. In this case, I would like to use three colors – red, green and blue. The password would be the combination of these colors in a specific order. Biometric system: The last step would be to authenticate using the user’s fingerprint. Things of what needed to be done: 1. I have the first and second steps implemented with me in .NET framework. 2. I have the Biomini suprema fingerprint scanner for the third step. Will that be used to integrate with the first two steps of my project if I give you the code for the first two steps? 3. I want all the user records to be stored in a database.            "

95,http://1000projects.org/web-designed-system-university-project.html,web designed system university project.," INTRODUCTION OF THE PROJECT This project is a web-based application, which will be helpful to the students all over the world. This Web Designed System for University project was developed with the purpose of making students all over the world comfortable in getting different types of information of the University. This Web-based application will allow user to surf various hierarchies, get its information and also fill in the admission forms. This Web Designed System Web Site is made very user friendly and even the layman will find it very comfortable in using it. It has several important features like mark sheets, merit list, forms, site map, etc.           This Web Designed System application is easy to use at the same time efficient enough to serve purpose. This project is an attempt to gather the various scattered information about University. So, by doing this, we utilize IT in bringing comfort and cutting an edge for bringing the development of the University. SYSTEM ANALYSIS PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION One of the most difficult tasks of the system is the problem identification of the existing system. Without the clear understanding of the problem in the system, any further work done will lead to wastage of time and energy at a later stage. This stage involves identifying the root cause of the problem in the existing system and reach to it. This makes it possible to incorporate further modifications in the current system so as to make it more feasible. ACTUAL PROBLEM: The existing Web Designed System lacks details about the information about the admission process in any faculty. The mark sheet of any particular student cannot be obtained from the system, so the student has to personally contact his/hers college. The merit list of any particular admission process cannot be obtained online, so the students have to meet personally to the college for the same. SOLUTION: Developing a website is a much easier way to reach students all over the world as compared to other media such as advertisements, newspapers, etc. The students feel quite comfortable by using the site, as much of their time and energy is saved by not meeting the institution personally. FEASIBILITY STUDY AND COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS This report is the output of the Web Designed System analysis, which is carried out at the onset of this system. It tells us that the system requested is feasible. This study involves through analysis of the existing system. After the thorough study of the system, feasibility study is being made. This report includes the following: EXISTING SYSTEM  It includes brief information of University, courses offered, etc. It includes the brief note from the Chairman about the University and their contact numbers. There is a lack of interactive section for all those who wish to enroll in the University and also lacks in access of the mark sheets of any particular student. There is also a lack of many features like online merit system, online search of the site, etc. The existing system is not capable of letting users send their thoughts, opinions, suggestions, etc. regarding the university.  CURRENT DEFICIENCIES IN THE EXISTING SYSTEM  The existing system does not include the detailed information about the admission process in the University. It does not include the fees infrastructure for any course offered. It does not contain the detailed information about the web site, so the layman would find difficult to access it, as there is no search mechanism or any site map. It does not contain the mark sheet system for the current year, and also the merit list for any particular entrance test conducted. The information is a bit scattered and too brief, so the student interested have to meet personally to the university.  NEED FOR THE NEW WEB BASED SYSTEM The inconvenience of the people and the confusion in accessing the scattered information about the University paved the way for the development of the web-based system. Main reasons for the development of the new web based system:  To help students in easily gathering the scattered information. To facilitate students in getting and filling up the forms. To help students in accessing detailed knowledge about the city and the university their in. By creation of such user-friendly web based system the University would definitely prosper, as more and more people would be able to know about the university and the excellent courses offered with in. To help students in gathering the detailed list of the courses offered and their durations. To use IT for the general purpose. By this application, it is assumed that the students will come closer to the University and much of their grievances will be removed.  GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE NEW WEB BASED SYSTEM There are certain goals and objectives set for this Web Designed System. They are as follows:  It should bring people closer to the University by providing necessary information. Facilitate the students in getting desired admissions forms and merit lists. Use IT for the benefit of the students all around the world. Simplify the working of the whole organization. Students should feel comfortable in getting forms as well as the information related to the University. Provide a smooth touch in the working of the University. Make the University courses and the admission process more transparent to the layman. Speed up the task of accessing necessary information. To help individuals in solving there problems regarding the University and the web site and provide relatively better solutions.  PROJECT PROFILE PROJECT:  Website development for University.

This project is a type of innovation according to the new technology.  According to new technology we use a pen drive port number as a primary key for user use. Actually this project is a type of future implicated application. We can use a pen drive for both data storage and also for ATM access. It provide a type of portability for us. In today time it is very difficult to keep both the pen drive and ATM card in a pocket, the possibility of misplacing of very high but if we use pen drive as a ATM Card then we can easily maintain the pen drive for both purpose.           According to new technology pen drives are made as a very small device by which it can easily managed. In future this technology has very importance for us.  Snapshots Of ATM Using Pen Drive:  Front Page: Pendrive Unique Number: Admin Login: Admin Panel: User Registration: Registered User Login: Account Type: User Account: Balance Withdraw: Balance Enquiry: Mini Statement: User Account Updation:  FUTURE SCOPE The pen drive has indeed revolutionized the way we work and also the manner in which we work. Pen drives help us to carry our work to our home and carry all our important documents in our shirt pocket wherever we move. These pen drives are immune to dust, fungus and shocks which were the chief culprits in destroying the floppies. The innumerable times aspen drives can be written on to make it a slower version of your hard disk. You can store pictures, songs, documents and all sorts of files which you need to carry around. The newer version of pen drive with their astounding 32GBstorage capacity are capable of recording upto 12 hours of nonstop audio. These high end pen drives often have LCD displaysfor browsing through he files stored in the drive. These pendrives feature a mini USB port, an audio input and audio outputport with rechargeable batteries. Many manufacturers havecome out with tiny speakers for use with the pen drive shouldyour do not feel like using the earphones. ADVANTAGES 1. In modern times people usually carry pen drives for data storage. If pen drive could be used as an ATM card then it will allow the user to withdraw money from their account along with the data storage. 2. Higher aggregate bandwidth 3. High speed Mbps and possibly Gbps 4. Scalabilit CONCLUSION Finally we manufacture a software which used to access the ATM which is easier and less complex. It is good facility that provides money transaction ,payment bill, shopping, data storage and such type of other services. It has no magnetic tape so it has a long life and many information like mini statement, payment slip, available amount. fund transfer and such type of details can be stored in the pen drive. So some of these questions which will be answered after completion of final module of project.            "
98,http://1000projects.org/crime-records-management-system-project-synopsis.html,crime records management system project synopsis.," INTRODUCTION We see that when a group or society is formed then some rules and laws are made by the people, for the people and to the people. The purpose of these rules and laws are to give a comfortable life to all who are living in that society. Whenever any law is violated by any one then we say that crime is committed and who break that law is called CRIMINAL and to realize that person his/her mistake, there is also a criteria of punishment. Some times these crimes are committed by same/different people in same /different manner repeatedly. So we have to manage a record of such type of people so that when any special type of crime is committed then that criminal can easily traced out and punish them so that they do not do that crime in future. The basic entity of this System is FIR. Any victim can lodge a request for FIR through INTERNET from any place. It is not necessary that it should be lodged at same place where the crime occurred. As request lodged, it will automatically reached to the server of the nearest Police Station from the place of crime occurred with the help of information given in the Request Form. At the server side this request will be converted into an FIR and the case will hand over to the Investigation Officer of that Police Station. The IO will investigate the case on the basis of information given in FIR, arrest the suspect or criminal, collect the evidences, inquire the people on the spot and maintain his/her case diary, give his/her report on that case to Magistrate and case will be transfer to COURT where the final decision will taken out on that case and if suspect is proved CRIMINAL, the court will punish him/her. On the basis of court decision the information records such as crime record, criminal record are maintained.           For the easy retrieval of information or data the Databases are maintained at different levels of hierarchy of this System which are state, district, police station Due to its easily accessible quality and complete Database this system helps the Police Force in collecting information of crime occurred, helps IO in his/her investigation by giving records of old criminal and crime occurred and helps Police Force to control on the occurrence of crime. The overall advantage of this System is basically for Police Force in achieving her objectives i.e. maintain peace in society by proper following of rules and laws.

99,http://1000projects.org/library-management-system-net-project.html,library management system net project.," LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM This is the Library Management System software which is used to computerize any Library System, so that all the transactions become fast and there should not be any error in transactions. It replaces all the paper work. Opening the software requires to login with user name and password. It performs all the features of the modern library that is book issue, return, and fine calculation. Reader can issue books, return books and find books in the library by a simple search done on the book id. Fine can be updated or changed depending on the requirements of the administrator. It keeps records of all the books, given to the customers, so that administrator could update his daily reports. Reader and book details also maintained and the administrator holds the main account. Security and authentication are maintained by keeping a record of reader names and passwords; the administrator holds the main account and password. Different reports can be generated like daily reports and the user report, book type report and the book code report. NEED ANALYSIS  With the advancement of Computers and its Technologies brought a revolution in the world, it hit every aspect of life. Nowadays every field and its working are computerized. It is very beneficial as our paper work is reduced to a minimum. So it is essential that we have a library that is computerized and equipped to deal with the daily transactions in an efficient way so that maximum work is done and the performance increased. So there is a need to develop software that can cope up with all these requirements and that is cost as well as time effective. We have developed such an project that can cope with the daily needs of a library that includes transactions like issue a book, return a book, search a book.           Now, with computerized Library Management System we aim to present users with much more better and easier interface and search options and side by side provide other options like details of books and readers and options like fine management which includes calculation work. One may encounter the difficulties of finding the required product or the same process might be very hectic on many website. OBJECTIVES The goals of this project are: –  Security – The user has to provide password in order to enter. Hence it provides security. Easiness – The user simply has to follow series of instruction which makes project very simple to use. Speedup result processing – While manually it may take time to search for books but it helps to speed up processing. And also issue and return processes are easy. Also database for students and books help in speeding up work of management of library Library management system is software for automating the manual library system of a college. Functionalities of active library like issuing of books, returning of books and query processing. The Books and Students are given a particular unique id no.  So that they can be accessed correctly and without errors. Our main aim of the project is to get the correct information about a particular student and books available in the library Library management system is standalone in nature. Keep the record of updated books & students database. The project is implemented to bring a simpler interface for the users and provide them with easy search and access methods.  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS Software Requirement  Microsoft Windows 2000 or above. .Net platform Microsoft Access.  Other Requirements  Internet connection for online help  Diagrams:  E-R Diagram Data Flow Diagram Activity Diagram Database Tables      Output Screens: Login Form Administrator Menu (Parameters)  Administrator Menu (Security) Security  User Maintenance  Administrators Menu (Utility)  Librarian Menu Librarian Menu (Book Options) Add A New Book Readers Options (Find A Book) Readers Options (Edit Book Details)  Librarian Menu (Readers Options) Librarian Menu (General Options) Today’s Issue Inquirey Issue A Book Return A Book Find A Book Reports User Report Book Code Report Book Type Report About Menu LIMITATIONS:   The project is designed to run on a single machine, no option to run on a network of computers  (LAN etc.).  The designing of project is not up to the level of software market, it has a lot of scope to improve.   There is no option for reader if he/she forgot password. If he or she forgets his or her password they need to sign up again.   The reader or the administrator can use this one at a time, that means only one transaction can be  processed at one time that may be issue, return or any other.   The database is not vast.   There is no option for the payment receipt of the fine submission.  SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE WORK:   Project can be further enhanced with the facility to run project on multiple machines (LAN) so that more than one library for the same institution can be connected through same database and controlled by same mechanism.   In depth details regarding every the security aspects of the project needs to prepared and then taken steps taken or functionality included to preserve security.   Enhancements can be made to provide user with option that if one forgets his/her password then it can be changed or retrieved.   New option like option for the payment receipt of the fine submission can be included.  CONCLUSION:  Project in fully complete and running with every aspect of coding and connectivity with the database.   We have tried our best to present the simple interface to the user and remove the complexity of using a manual library like searching and fine calculation.             "

104,http://1000projects.org/online-web-portal-net-project.html,online web portal net project.," Project Title: Online Web Portal Category: Application Development, Enterprise.  A number of trends in computational science and engineering have increased the need for effective communication systems. The communication systems are characterized by the article multiplicity and social community. The communication system consists of a number of articles and blogs interconnected by a network. The web communication system integrated here facilitates information sharing by posting a contextual article and publishing it at a web interface of the system. A blog may be created because the user does wants to have the required information on the web. The blogs may also be organized collectively if the expected turn around time will be better.           From a user point of view, the set of anonymous readers in a communication system acts like a single virtual system. Hence, when an Author posts an article for publication, it becomes the responsibility of an administrator of the communication system to collect the ratings of the readers to processes and to rate the processes to suitable articles of the system according to these ratings. An Administrator organizes the processes in a communication system to make use of the system information in such a manner that Article usage, response time, blog creation, and comments over read are optimized variety of widely differing thoughts and solutions for communication processes of a Information system have been proposed. This communication process can be broadly classified into three types:   Article posting in which each article submitted by an Author (Administrator) for publication is viewed as a collection of related topics and these topics are posted to web interface so as to provide information.  Article rating in which all the ratings submitted by the readers are distributed among the articles of the system so as to emphasize the interest up on the article.  Blog creation which simply attempts to create the topic of the system to blog post by assuring that no idea is idle while information wait for being communicated.  Comment posting in which each comment submitted by a reader for communicating is viewed as a collection of related ideas and these ideas are shared to suitable reader so as to improve communication.  Of these communication processes, the information sharing has valuable applicability in practical situations because it works on the assumption that the readers of all the categories to be communicated are shared in views. Furthermore the creating blogs that fall in this system do interaction of the dynamically changing thoughts of the readers. Hence we are enabling the information sharing approach for better communication. The web communication approach is considered, as an appropriate solution because of the overwhelm involved in gathering information to achieve the objective is normally very quick, especially in communication systems having a large number of readers.

116,http://1000projects.org/x-ray-annotation-project-synopsis.html,x ray annotation project synopsis.," Introduction: The project deals with X-Ray Annotation. An X-Ray is a form of electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength in the range of 10 to 0.01 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies, x-rays are primarily used for diagnostic radiography and crystallography. X-rays are a form of ionizing radiation.           It utilizes electromagnetic radiation to produce an image of an object, and usually with the purpose of visualizing something located below the objects surface. Medical x-rays are being produced; a thin metallic sheet is placed between the emitter. The basic production of x-rays is by accelerating electrons in order to collide with a metal target. By testing x-rays we all would like to find out how we stand on important health issues or other health related conditions, which could adversely affect our lives. Medical terms related to x-rays often begin with time to time checkup. This report compares x-rays monitoring systems, point-by-point approach is used here to determine the overall best choice by using C#.Net Software and it stores in a particular place. At the end of the report, we have the list of information sources. This report uses the number system in which the sources are numbered, and these numbers are used along with page references in the body of the report to indicate the source of borrowed information. ABSTRACT: In these days, people can be adversely affected by a disease whose effects could have been prevented by time to time testing by using C#.Net based windows application and it can be stored in particular place and later can be changed with the same application. The X-Ray Annotation project is developed for X-ray Annotation, Annotation as per medical terminology it is a process of furnishing critical commentary or explanatory notes, i.e. thesis writing and writing a summary on the X-Ray, just like the programmer often adds annotations to source code in the form of comments. These do not affect the working of the program but give explanations. In the digital imaging community the term annotation is commonly used for visible metadata superimposed on an X-rays without changing the underlying raster X-rays. An X-ray is a form of electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength in the range. It utilizes electromagnetic radiation to produce an image of an object, usually with the purpose of visualizing something located below the objects surface. The key benefit is the durability of the x-ray taken as it is stored in picture Format, rather than usual film based x-ray, the sophisticated tool give an accurate look of the x-ray and enable the doctor to work on it to point the diseased area and make a information note on that area itself. This X-Ray Annotation tool also enables to save the picture file in a particular picture format, this adds security to the picture from editing it with a photo editor to enhance to safety to the confidential information. C#.Net Software develops to create and access information that is not going to be part of the source file itself such annotations are usually part of several software development activities. Application  This X-Ray Annotation application will be helpful in computerizing the X-Ray process making it much easier process in storing and making report on the X-Ray taken. This report uses the number system in which the sources are numbered, and these numbers are used along with page references in the body of the report to indicate the source of borrowed information. Using this application annotation process can be done in an efficient way  Advantage • You can create portfolio and send it to you potential customers • Annotations can be read from source files, class files, or reflectively at run time. • Image storage is of a prescribed format and cannot be viewed by other image Editors • Annotations usually follow the text of the statue they interpret in annotated statutes. • Annotation can be added by compiler or programmer. Disadvantage • X-ray image are stored in particular format, which can be viewed only by This application. • Image conversion may lead to data loss Block diagram             "

There are many ERP available till now in the market for product planning, purchase, manufacturing or service delivery, marketing and sales, inventory management, shipping and payment, finance,etc… so here we have designed a ERP which is only meant for education.           In this ERP we have different users like administrator,faculty,HOD,Dean,Director ,Students .each user has different activities in the ERP. if the ERP is used by students the activities are fill student form, course registration, fee deposit etc. if the user is a faculty the activities are fill faculty form, check student details for his/her course, upload marks, apply leaves, etc. If the user is HOD/Dean or Director then the user can check class status of any branch (at that time which class is going on and which faculty is taking the class), accept/reject leaves for faculty, publish notice etc.. The administrator is the king Of the ERP. So the administrator can control over all the users. Some Extra features are also included in this project like students attendance; sending notifications via SMS. We have designed this ERP using ASP.NET as front end (graphical user interface) and SQL SERVER as back end (Database).            "

Risks are imminent in any models (ERP, CRM etc).  An ERP is a combination of HR, Accounting, and Payroll, Customer Relationship Management, Inventory Management etc. The SAP is one of the ERP application platform providers. Here, we shall concentrate on building a prototype ERP application (web-based), say a company portal managing the HR systems. HR activities include onboarding of new recruits, exits of existing resources, incentive decision making, generic approvals/rejections etc.           The same can be shared with your team as a prototype of an ERP. Considering the time constraint of 8 days, HR portal is something which we can come up with. The SQL server (backend scripts) would be provided along with front-end asp.net based application – the source code. Please Note: If you have to demonstrate the system to others, the system must be equipped with below requirements : Please note, the documentation work for  Visual Studio 2010 or higher should have been installed.

It can be vehicle tracking for a transportation company or it can be a marketing employee tracking for a company.           The effective tracking helps the administration to streamline its managerial tasks and so can increase the productivity. Currently it is big challenge for companies to keep track of their marketing employees in order to validate their work. Position tracker works on GPS (Global Positioning System) and GPRS. The users need to activate the application and application will keep updating the location of the user after particular interval. at any moment Position tracker web portal allows the manager to check the location of a particular marketing agent and can also check entire roadmap of his movement from one location to another. 2, Challenge Challenge is to create a well planned tracking method which reduces the cost of information exchange, but at the same time automate the entire tracking process. Challenge is to receive and process multiple user inputs and make it available online for the administration to track and monitor. Challenge is to develop, integrate and deploy different technological components to achieve one single aim called tracking. 3, Proposed Solution Proposed GPS Position Tracker solution consists of a Symbian client application which will automatically keep updating the longitude and latitude of the user to the web service after particular interval. A web service will receive the location based information from the mobile and process it. The portal which implemented via Google maps will show the exact location of the users online. Portal can be accessed by different users. Administrator or manager can keep track of their marketing employees who roam around for marketing their products. Managers can log in to portal and for a particular user, get the entire report of his location movement. For a company is into transportation, can track their vehicles easily by checking online at any time from anywhere. 4, System Diagram  5, Technology GPS Position tracker requires two components: 1. Position tracker Portal software The responsibility of this component is to receive the location information from several mobile users via Position Tracker mobile software. This component will also store the location data into database. This component will also allow users to see the locations in Google Maps. Technologies –  • Microsoft .Net • Visual C# language • ASP.Net • ASP.Net web service • SQL Server • Google Maps API • XML 2. Position tracker mobile software This GPS Position Tracker software widget needs to be installed on mobile. The responsibility of this component is to get the current location of the user via GPS and upload it to web portal via HTTP transfer using GPRS. Technologies: • Symbian Operating System for mobiles • C++ • XML 6, Future enhancements Position tracker can be developed further to analyze the minimum shortest path between the check points and help administrator to decide routes to minimize the transportation costs. This system can be used for understanding the time taken between places thus administrator can roughly assess the time taken for a vehicle to reach destination. 7, Conclusion Position Tracker is a tracking platform, so it can be modified to fit to any business use-case and since it is used on mobiles and internet so we will get upto date information at very less cost.

134,http://1000projects.org/outage-impact-retrieval-remote-server-monitoring-system.html,outage impact retrieval remote server monitoring system.," Organizations with many servers that host multiple applications find it difficult to maintain their servers. An applications running on a server may be dependent on some application running on another server. An outage in one server may lead to abandoning of job in multiple related servers. This can lead to tedious efforts in rolling back dependent jobs that would be in an inconsistent state because of outage. If the outage timings are known beforehand, the jobs in dependent servers can be planned accordingly. The basic objective of this tool is to help the project members obtain information about planned outages and get SMS and mail alerts in case of unplanned outages.           The architecture of the tool could be split into:- 1. Backend – Sql SERVER 2008 2. Front end – ASP.NET (One Windows batch application and a web application) 3. Scheduler- Windows job scheduler Front end involves developing forms to get the inputs from the user like name of server, location, start and end time and impacted day. The user can enter any or all of the details, based on which a dynamic query will be generated in the backend to fetch impacted servers. The details of impacted servers will be displayed in a gridview. The user will be provided an option to export the details to excel sheet as well. Backend involves the data model, development of scripts & loading the tables with server and job details. Details of location of server, planned outage duration and day of the week on which the job is run are among the important details that are to be captured. A stored procedure must be written to generate a dynamic query based on user input and execute the generated query to obtain details of impacted servers. Another form will be provided to users to register their contact details and name of desired server for which they would want to update details of future planned outages. If any entry is added in outage tables for the specified server, the user will be sent an alert. There is one more windows application written to ping servers at frequent intervals. If any server that does not have an entry in outage tables of database is unable to be reached, an alert mail and message is sent to recipients configured in web.config file. A list of jobs that are to be run mandatorily are also configured in a table along with the expected start and end timings. Once a server is found reachable, a job status check is carried out. If the job runs beyond the expected time or fails to run, an alert is sent to configured recipients. At times of network outage, situations may arise to use systems not connected to cognizant or client network. If there is a power outage, the process running on the system may get impacted. Hence a job is written to send alert mails in case the power state of a system goes offline. The details of jobs that have failed are added to database. A dashboard showcasing the list of servers that are unexpectedly down and list of processes that have failed for the current day is to be designed. The dashboard will set to be refreshed every 10 minutes. Advantages:- Reduces time and effort in rolling back transactions that are dependent on server that unexpectedly has an outage Helps to plan tasks that are dependent on the servers with planned outage. Development Methodology:- Water Fall method of software development will be used for developing the tool. Various phases are as given below: • Refining the requirements • High level design (backend and front end) • Detailed design (backend and front end) • Coding and Unit testing (developing the scripts & front end frames) • System testing & Data validation • Integration testing • Implementation • User acceptance testing (UAT) Tools and Technologies: Operating System : Windows, Android Languages : SQL, ASP.NET Framework : Bootstrap Database : SQL server using ODBC connection Messaging : N/A Web server : N/A Application Server : N/A Commercial Packages (COTS): N/A Testing Others: Manual testing DOES THE WORK INVOLVE BOTH CODING AND TESTING? Yes, this work involves coding and testing. DOES THE WORK INVOLVE ONLY DESIGN AND NO CODING? My work involves design, coding and testing. DOES THE WORK INVOLVE A NEW OR AN EMERGING TECHNOLOGY?

It is a web application that adds feeds, such as news, blogs, podcasts and video blogs in one place to facilitate viewing. It allows its users to see and manage their registered feeds in one place. There are no restrictions on the formats of all RSS formats, the atom, etc. are supported, hence the name Universal Feed Reader Management System. Problem Specification In the current scenario, the user follows his favorite set of sites by visiting them manually and checking out if any latest are available or subscribes to it via email, then feeds are sent to his email. Both these methods are cumbersome and time taking. UThe user may skip some important updates on a site tired of clicking and navigating through pages on a website. Email feeds are also very uninteresting as they involve clicking on each email separately and also results in cluttering of Inbox. Every user may have a list of his favorite websites that he wishes to follow regularly, a user may not be able to remember all these websites.S o it is important to organize and store this list. Therefore the task is to automate these manual processes of navigation and organization. Hence, automation of the existing system is proposed as a solution to solve the problem.           UML Diagrams: Use case Diagram:    Objective of Project The main purpose of this application is to eliminate the need to visit each and every website manually to catch up latest updates, by organizing them in one place. And enable the user to read websites in an elegant and easy to grasp way, manage subscribed websites at single place and view feeds based on category. Limitations of Project It works only when the internet is available. It’s Not run on windows environment, its run only on web environment. And all applications are not providing RSS. Scope The Aim is to provide an automated and integrated solution to the process of feed reading and gathering. The user can now organize his favorite collection of websites and view them in a simple and interactive environment. There are three types of users in this system. They are:  Admin User  The following describes the Roles of all the users in this System.  Admin: An admin in the system takes care of authorization and authentication, responsible for background functions like crawling for feed updates. The process of the administrator is automated no external supervision is required. User: A User feeds the application with his set of favorite URLs and organizes them based on category. The user after feeding a valid URL to the application can view the feeds from the website. He can even bookmark a specific URL in the feeds for later reference. He can also remove the URLs and categories that he previously added.  Modules User/Register Module This is the module responsible for authentication and authorization of users. Register module is responsible for authentication of the user and adding to the database. Updates Module This module is responsible for calculating a number of updates of a particular URL, It has a background script which runs periodically and fetches the feeds and stores the URL and published date. It uses this information to calculate a number of updates since users last visit. Add/Remove Module In this module, the Users can add or delete websites and organize into categories. And can also add multiple websites at once. Admin Module This module enables the Users to share specific URL/article that they like to social networking sites like youtube. PROBLEM IN EXISTING SYSTEM  Need To go every website for updates. No use of Web Services and Remoting.  SOLUTION OF THESE PROBLEMS  The development of the new system contains the following activities, which try to automate the entire process keeping in view of the database integration approach.  User friendliness is provided in the application with various controls. The system makes the overall project management much easier and flexible.

175,http://1000projects.org/inventory-control-system-vb-net-project.html,inventory control system vb net project.," The project titled “Inventory Control System” is to control the general stores department. Hindustan Shipyard Limited is an automation of issuing an item to different departments inside the organization, returning back the item to the stores if the department doesn’t have any need with the item or if the stock is full, issuing the receipt to the department to whom the item is being issued, checking the balance of the stock of each item, making a new purchase of an item if the store doesn’t contains the stock of that particular item. The purchase of an item is indifferent modes i.e., local abroad and indigenous. If the item is purchased locally then it is said to be local. If the item is imported from other countries then it is said to be imported. If the item is purchased from any department inside the organization then it is said to be indigenous.            The project contains five modules: Issue Module, Returns Module, Receipts Module, Balance Module and Purchase Module. The Issue Module contains the information about the item are issued by the department to various other department in the organization. This module contains the following fields as card code, item code, department code, work order number, document number, transaction date, rate of the item, quantity of the item to be issued, its value. The Returns Module contains the information about the item are issued by the department to various other department in the organization. This module contains the same fields as in the issue module they are as follow fields card code, item code, department code, work order number, document number, rate of the item, transaction date, quantity of the item to be issued, its value. The Receipts module contains the information about the item that are issued and address of the department to which the item was sold are the supplier details. The details contains the following fields as card code, item code, department Code, order number, document number, transaction date, rate of the item, quantity of the item to be issued, its supplier details.

The Purchase module contains the information about the purchase that made by the department. Whenever the department needs any new item, the value of the purchased item is calculated according to the mode of purchase i.e. local, abroad, indigenous. We can make addition of a new item, deletion, modification, etc for this file. It contains the fields such as item code, item desc, units, quality grade, item value. Inventory control system is a client/server application. Software requirements Visual Basic.Net front end, MS SQL Server back end. SYSTEM REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION The data processing department is accepting many requests, which comes from different department. Currently the request like updates, stop details, issues, returns are done manually. So they would like to automate it. We have to first understand this problem and produce a requirement documents based on understanding the problem. End User: Office Staff While studying the current system, after speaking with the director, front office staff we found the system as follows. Whenever a new work comes, the work is divided into different parts and each part is submitted to the respective department. The respective department checks their work and the material needed for their work. If the material is sufficient for them for doing their work to carry out with it otherwise they send a request for Data Processing Department for the issue for the material. The data Processing Department then sends a request to stores department whether the mat is available or not. If the material is available they will issue it otherwise they will place as an order. If the allocated material is more than sufficient, the respective departments will handover that extra material to Data Processing Department by a note. Then the Data Processing Department will update their respective stores. In automating the whole process we find that the inventory system consists of three main parts. 1. ISSUES: This process is used to store the issue details of the item which is requested by the respective department. 2. RETURNS: This process is used to store the return details of the item, which IS the respective department. 3. RECEIPTS: This process is used to store the receipt details of the item, which is attested by the respective department. After discussion with the staff the following decisions were taken regarding what the automated systems should do and what new environment will be. 1.    The format for each entry should be similar over currently being used. 2.    Entries might have errors, so system should be able to check for errors. 3.    Information about the items, departments, and work orders should be kept in permanent database. Requirement Specification Document: Introduction: Purpose: The purpose of this document is to describe the external requirement for the atomization of stock details. The atomization will provide management to accept item details and quality. It also describes the interface for the system. Scope: The document is the only one that describes the requirements of the system. It is meant for the use by and will also be the basis for validating the full system. Any change made to the requirements in future will have to go through a formal change approval process. The developer is responsible for asking for classification whenever necessary and will give any alteration without the permission of the client. Conversion Methods: Conversion methods are of four types these are parallel systems, direct cut over method, pilot method and phase in method. Each method has some advantages it offers and some problems that it may cause. However some situations force one method to be used over others, even though other methods may be more beneficial. In general, system conversion should be accomplished as quickly as possible. The present module contains the same fields as in the issue module they are as follows card code, item code, department code, work order number, document number, transaction date, rate of the item, quantity of the item to be issued., its value etc., Receipts Module: This module contains the information about the items that are issued and their the details of the department to which the item was sold and the supplier details. This module contains the following fields as card code, item code, department code, order number, document number, transaction date, rate of the item, quantity of the item to be issued, its value, supplier details etc. Balance Module: This module contains the information about the balance that is/was present before/after the issue of each item and about the new stock. This module contains the following fields as card code, item code, department code, transaction date, rate of the item, quantity of the item to be issued, its value. Purchase Order Master: This module contains the information about the purchases that are made by the department. Whenever the department needs any new item, system is developed using ORACLE 7.3 as backend and VISUAL BASIC 6.0 as front end that helps us to create easier and flexible data entry. The system automation that has been developed will be installed in the organization in a phased manner. This helps the end user who will be using the system in future to get a feel of the system. This also helps the end user to clarify their doubts and get rid any reservations or inhabitations that they have. The phased manner approach that the organization is implementing makes it possible systematic automated system. CONCLUSION After completing the proposed system successfully it is worth to talk about the limitations and advantages of the system. LIMITATIONS: This system is capable of fulfilling the current requirements, but it is required to make modification to meet the future requirements. Disk space to increased when information increases. ADVANTAGES: As all the screens are self explanatory it is easy to work with the system with a little training for new operator. The system eliminated the problem of the existing system and enhances its capability.            "

The Students and Staff ip addresses are maintained separately in a database.We use separate colors like green , red etc for identifying which of those system pen drive is accessed.  We track the various activities of the students and staff like taking print outs, Reading and writing CDs also files accessing , creating and modifying it.  We use VB.NET which is an Object Oriented Programming Language for the Construction of Client Server architecture. We use Sql Server  for storing the data like Ip address of the system etc.           For the alerts of various hardware and software usage, we use Special Controls in .net Platform. This Remote Device Explorer System project will help the network administrator to track the accessibility of its various node and  to monitor any misuse of the system resources.  At times, virus software which often get transmitted into the network through the pen drives is to monitored carefully. Also, the reports can be taken day wise or month wise etc for the usage of various network resources. This facility will enable the administrator and the management incharge to take necessary precautions in future to avoid any misuse of the Network resources.  Modules: Modules:  Identifying Systems in Network Group. Registration of Admin / Staff/ Student System. Monitoring of System Peripherals. Monitoring of Software Applications. Performance Comparison by admin.  Modules Description: Identifying Systems in Network Group: In this module, we are going to identify the number of System which all connected in the network. And all the system in the network has been categories by Admin, Staff, and Student. Registration of Admin / Staff/ Student System: In this module the user in the network has been register according to their category and authority. Admin is the one he has authority for monitoring and controlling the whole network (Staff/Students).The Staff in the network can register in the network by selecting user name and password (unique) according to his need. The Students in the network can register in the network by selecting user name and password (unique) according to his need. All the user name of student/staff has been maintain by the admin and admin user name and password has been maintained very secret in the network.  Monitoring of System Peripherals: In this module server will monitor the number of user (students/staff) in the network and start monitor them. The admin will monitor that who are all using peripherals device like Pen drive, CD, Printer. Monitoring of Software Applications: In this module admin will monitor the user (staff/students) process by files, document, application used by users by file watcher, it also check client connection, web application also. Performance Comparison by admin: In this module the admin will calculate the performance of each user (staff/students) in the network by their process, and activity done in the system. 1. Identification of Admin / Client System In this module, Server identifies the clients which are connected in the network. Server also categories the Client system as student and staff. 2. Monitoring of Remote Devices In this module, Server get access to all clients which are using the Remote devices such as Pen drive, CD, Printer etc., also Server can get the details of processing of files and documents of clients by File Watcher. 3. Monitoring by Administrator In this Module, Administrator monitoring the Remote Devices which are get connected in network. And also monitoring the individual access of the client , servers and remote devices.  Existing System : 1) The hardware and systems are maintained only by using the Operating System security features. 2) No Usb slot access control are available. 3) No Acess control and tracking mechanism implemented for CDs,printers and Scanners. 4) No virus protection is updated and maintained.   Proposed System : Remote Device Explorer System is designed in such a way to categorize as staff and students systems. These IP   addresses are updated in a separate database to monitor each system based on category wise.   RDESServer has the user interactive GUI to display various device status from remote systems. The colors like green, red are used for identifying staff and students system respectively which of those USB drive is accessed. Also the working status of various devices such as CDs, printers, scanners is tracked in this system. RDESServer additionally has File monitoring facility such as creations, modifications and deletions of the files from remote systems. Remote Device Explorer is an enterprise endpoint security software solution providing network administrators with the ability to secure, monitor and control computer ports and external devices as part of an information security program. The solution protects against internal data leakages occurring when confidential data is printed or copied from internal workstations and laptops to unauthorized portable storage devices through unmanaged USB, LTP, COM, Firewire and IEEE 1394 ports. Advantages of Proposed System : 1)    Any hardware added to the network can be monitored and controlled for access. 2)    The integrated solution for complete network monitoring and maintenance is possible. 3)    The Reports functionality enables the administrator to bring about accountability To the network access. 4)    This proposed Remote Device Explorer System protects the internal data leakage. 5)    The device explorer system is far safer and sophisticated compared to the operating system security features.

The approval of the registrar of companies (ROC) and the securities and exchange board of India (SEBI) is a necessity. Synopsis A computerized share management system would be able to handle the following functions.           Modules   Maintain shareholders details and the share kept by them Keep track of share transfer Generate divided warrants Provide information on shareholdings to the company management Generate statuary reports   ABOUT THE PROJECT INTRODUCTION Share Management System is an application which manages the shares of a company. Every organization tries to build up their resources and increase their business.For increasing the business they need lots of funds.Raising the funds are of so many types among which issuing of shares is one of the methods.After issuing the shares a private sector converts to a public sector.When an organization becomes a public sector the responsibility and accountability also increases. EXISTING SYSTEM The Existing System is not a computerized system.In this method and dependency of human and paper work is lot.As it is depending on the human beings the processing of each and every transaction takes more time.Even though the computers are implemented the data is not centralized.Which leads to lot of difficulties.All  the transactions made by officials and customers needed to be recorded in their individual systems.And the security and privacy of data is always an issue.In order to have a secured database and centralized server the system is to be changed.  PROPOSED SYSTEM A Proposed share management system is for removing all the disadvantages and difficulties raised by the Existing System.The proposed system is to create a complete application on the basis of client-server architecture. The system is to provide a website for the shareholder through which the shareholders are get informed in every bid of the share.The facilities needed to be provided for the share holders are : 1.Online Applying for Shares 2.Online Share transfer Facilities 3.Daily Purchase and sales reports Apart of creating a website for shareholder the system is to provide easy a management system for official and management where management can check out applications for the shares and allot the shares for individual customers.Where the system takes care of auto-generation of folio number and allotment of shares done properly. For the officials the system is supporting with issuing of shares generating certificates and maintaining  the certificates details.  DEFINITION Share management system refers to keeping track of the ownership of the shares of a company. A share represents part of a company. The shares department of this company maintains a share register to record details of each shareholder, including the number of shares he owns and the share certificates he holds. DESCRIPTION The Share Management System consists of three modules. 1.Share Holder 2.Management 3.Official Share Holder A person who applies for the shares will become as a share holder to that company.Each share holder is identified by a unique folio number .With this number only he/she can do all his/her transactions Management Management is nothing but the company who issues shares into the market based on their assets and in-order to increase their investment.Management will decide how many shares has to allot to a particular person and dividends also decided by the management. Official: These are the middle mans between the share holders and the management.These people are meant for the data entry purpose and for doing the share transactions.And also he/she will give information to the share holders regarding their share information.

181,http://1000projects.org/smtp-mail-server-vb-net-project.html,smtp mail server vb net project.," PRESENT STATUS  OF THE SYSTEM: The existing SMTP Mail Server system that the client has security problems.In the current world of competition ,it is rather becoming a difficult task for the administration to keep a track on access rights  for different users at a given point of time.It becomes highly important for  the firm  to  have  a secure system  in which they provide strict access restrictions.The firm now requires an all new package that does exactly what other Provider do. The management has put in a substantial amount of time in designing a system that perfectly matches their requirements.           The current SMTP Mail Server system has a login created for each user and has their mail box created or associated with each one of them. The administrator maintains them. This is a complex setting in which each user can send and receive mails throughout the world. Each user and his mailbox have to be taken care of by the administrator.  PROPOSED SYSTEM The SMTP Mail Server System ,which wanted by the end-user,is the proposed system.This project is designed by using the problem statement.Proposed system is the system in which it eliminates the problems in the existing system. CONCLUSION The objective of the SMTP Mail Server VB.Net Project deals with identifying multiple users within the same login domain and they will sign in into their personal logins which enables them to send and receive mails. The system was tested successfully and has performed to the expectations. The goal of the system is achieved and problems are solved. Black box testing was conducted and errors were eliminated. The utility can be used by ASP.NET end users (multiple clients) and can be ensured sending and receiving of mails. Finally the information is generated as per the specification of the users. The package is developed in a manner that it is user friendly and required help is provided at different levels.  MODULE DESCRIPTION: The SMTP Mail Server VB.Net project consists of the following five modules: 1.User administration. 2.Mail organization. 3.Message composition. 4.Message Address list 5.Message Deletion. Mail Organization Module This module deals the organization of mails. When the users are created ,a directory with     the user-id as its name should be created along with four sub directories: Inbox, Compose and Address list. The Compose box contains the transmitted messages. The inbox contains all the incoming messages. The Address list box contains the users details that can be recovered. Message Composition Module This module deals with composing messages . It forms the information such as: “From” (Sender’s user-id), “To”(Receivers user-id), “Date of Transmission”, “Subject”, “Message” and “Attach” to be transmitted. The message is converted and stored as a file in the outbox of   the sender before it is being transmitted. The file name should be the combination of the  sender’s user-id and receiver’s user-id. The contents of the file should follow the following format:  From: To: Date: Subject: Message: Attach:  The module prompts the user for the file information that has to be transmitted. The messages can be user-typed information at runtime or messages that are part of the file. The user is supposed to type in the message or specify the file name. Other information such as from whom, the message is transmitted, to whom, it is being transmitted, date of transmission are also accepted. This information is stored in the following format:  From: To: Date of Transmission: Subject: Message: Attach:  This information is stored in a file that has the name of the user-id concatenated along with the name of the receiver’s user-id . The composed messages is then stored in the outbox of the sender. This file remains till it is selected and transmitted by transmit module. Every user’s composed message is stored in the user’s outbox. Message Address list Module This module is responsible for having all the personal users addresses which have been stored in the user’s Address. Once the user create all the contents of the file are displayed in the view file. These Contents are, from whom the message has been sent, date on which it was received, subject and the message. Message Deletion Module This module allows a user to delete a message by letting him browse through a list of messages that is part of his inbox. An option to empty the delete folder is provided so that recovering of deleted message is not possible. Output Screens:  Authentication Page: User Registration Page: User Login Page : Main Page: Whenever we click the InBox in this page, we see the all messages. Whenever we click view in any message of this page, we see the message and attachments. Whenever we click the Inbox in the above page, then this page redirect to Inbox page. Whenever we mark in the checkbox of the corresponding messages and we click Delete in this page, then that messages are deleted. Whenever we click on the Last Hyper Link, then we see the last messages in the datagrid. Whenever we click on the First Hyper Link, then we see the First messages in the datagrid. Whenever we click on the Next Hyper Link, then we see the next messages in the datagrid. Whenever we click on the Previous Last Hyper Link, then we see the previous messages in the datagrid. Whenever we press the Compose button in this page, then it redirects the Compose page. Whenever we click the Attach Hyper Link, then The Upload page will be displayed Whenever we click the Browse button in Upload Page, This is Shown a Open Dialog Box for find the file path what file do you want to attach. When we open the file, then the selected file path is shown in text box. After that we can upload it file to compose form. After uploading the require attached file path is shown in attachments text box in the Compose page. Whenever we click the send button this message sent to mail box and the below screen displayed. Whenever we click the Addresslist button in the left side frame, then address lists are displayed in datagrid in right side frame of this page. Whenever we click the AddNewContact hyperlink in hthe right side frame of this page, then the blow page is displayed. After enter the all information in this page and we click the Save Button then all information is stored in database. And it will be displayed in the “View All Contacts” Page as shown in the below screen. We want to change the contact information of the Suresh in database. Then we click the update link of the required field. Then we saw below page with existing data of consider person. In this time this page allows to modify the fields. After the Modification, click the save button then it saves and it display the screen. Whenever we click the Group mail combo box, this displays the current Group mails and allows the new group registration. If we choose any group in this list then the group mail id are displayed in the TO Text Box of Compose page. Whenever we select the NewGroup in the Group Mail Combo box then it is redirect. Whenever we click the save button then New group id will be created. And it shows in another page When we want to add another id into to group id then click update of corresponding group id then it will shows the Group register page with information of that group. After modification the below page will be displayed. When we want to delete particular group id then we click delete of corresponding group id. Then it will be deleted. Whenever we click the “Proj.

182,http://1000projects.org/system-resource-controller-vb-net-project.html,system resource controller vb net project.," Prologue Every system has resources which are very essential to have the designated task performed by the system as intended. Some of these resources are exposed to the outside world and some are not. Of all these only few can be controlled and others are not. This is to protect the system integrity and functionality from the novice and probing hands. But   in times of technological and information age, there is lot of information   to be shared without having any troubles. The sharing may be with in local intranet or remote internet. In these cases we need look for some issues which place crucial role in the system performance also.           Details In the above scenario, we may require to monitor and control the resources in a system for protecting as well as enhancing the performance of that system. But  the monitoring and controlling activities if done at local system level, the time and the effort needed are going to be unimaginably huge. In addition, the controlling/monitoring authority is not going to have a clear view of  ‘ what is what’ about the systems. The solution for this kind of issues is having the controlling and monitoring power at one end. From this terminal or system the other systems/ computers in the local intranet or remote internet can be controlled or monitored as the administrator/ controlling authority wishes to do.  Requirements: This proposed System Resource Controller solution requires a keen and carefully planned vision. As we are controlling the resources from a remote end, the network resource overloading is going to be a burden. Without causing much traffic the controlling has to be done. We are proposed to use some nifty components from the Windows Operating System for the effective controlling of the system resources in the network. At top level the issues that are going to be controlled monitored are…..  System Physical Resources Software Resources of a System The Network Resources Finally, Analytical Results of Scrutinization  PRELIMINARY PLANNING / INVESTIGATION To protect the system integrity and functionality from the novice and probing hands. In times of technological and information age, there is lot of information  to be shared without having any troubles. The sharing may be with in local intranet or remote internet. In these cases we need look for some issues which place crucial role in the system performance also. The goals of  SRC is protect system integrity and functionality, and to maintain performance Objectives: To achieve the above goal we need to achieve the following sub-goals or objectives… We need some nifty components from the Windows Operating System for the effective controlling of the system resources in the network. At top level the issues that are going to be controlled monitored are…..  System Physical Resources Software Resources of a System The Network Resources Finally, Analytical Results of Scrutinization.   Module Description: The System Resource Controller project is designed keeping in view of a Network Administrator’s requirements while administering the LAN.  As per the analysis results, the identified tasks should be achieved under single application in a much collaborative way providing complete required information at the finger tips of the Administrator. During the module design phase, the first two modules concentrate on user interface design for all tasks and privilege verification and authentications. The remaining modules focuses on the different tasks both designing and techniques. To recall, the identified tasks from the analysis are …  Gets the list of different domains / sub domains Gets the list of different system under domains / sub domains Gets the list of system switched ON Gets the list of logins (login enumeration) Gets the list of processes running on each system Gets list of each system startup time (?) Get the information about the memory usage of each system Get the CPU usage / load of an individual system Get the hardware details of an individual system Get the software details of an individual system Broadcasts messages to all systems Sends messages to all systems under specific domain / sub domain Sends messages to an individual system Kills a process in a system Shuts down, Reboot or logs off a system  Module 1: Interface Design One of the intrigued things while designing the System Resource Controller project is the interface design. It is some kind of one stop solution for the network administrator to perform most of the general and routine tasks.  The SRC has three layers of design …  Forms, where carefully placed controls are used to achieve different SRC tasks. MDI form, which links all other forms together at one place for easy access. Dialogs, which help the user / administrator in notifying some key events.  Sample forms are provided in the appendix Module 2: Privileges & Authentication In this module, we provide security for monitoring as well as controlling the resources of system under network. Security here is implemented in two stages. Stage one is from the existing Windows Network security policy, and stage two is from the SRC itself. The Windows Network Security policy will take care of the privileges of different groups identified by the domains. This directly controls the accessibility of the systems under different domains of the same network. These policies can be set by the administrator only once according the organization needs. The security adopted by the SRC on its own has another authentication system exclusively to access the SRC application itself. Administrator decides the users of the SRC application, along with different levels of access and utilization privileges. We utilize the System.Web.Security namespace partially here to provide certain level of security.  Module 3: Enumerating Domains & System One of the preliminary tasks in SRC is to know how many systems are present in the given network. This can be achieved by proper usage of system related API calls in addition to exploiting the.NET network namespaces. Herein this module we are going to enumerate the list of domains present in the network and the systems connected under each domain. For the purpose of enumerating we are taking the help of system.management namespace, which imbibes the WMI concept. We are concentrating on the following techniques to achieve our targets. Module 4: Enumerating Users Similar to the above task, the ‘Enumerating Users’ module also does the similar job. But here we are concentrating on the list of users rather than the systems and domains. This module enumerates the list of users from the Windows Network Authentication. It also gets the details of users and to which groups they belong. For the purpose of enumerating we are taking the help of system.management namespace, which imbibes the WMI concept. We are concentrating on the following techniques to achieve our targets. Module 5: Finding the Running Systems & Running Time  This module is little tricky. This module performs two different sub tasks.  Finding the working systems: This doesn’t mean that all the systems that are switched on. It goes a step ahead and finds out of all the systems that are on, which system is currently working (using system resources to perform some processes)   Finding the running time: This again is very difficult to find out how much time that each system is working. We are following a way round approach to find this. Our System Resource Controller is going to watch all the systems under network in the background. It notes down the time when the system boots up and shuts down, and calculates the difference to find out the approximately running time.  Module 6: Hardware Details  This module completely depends on WMI concepts to find out the hardware details. The GetObject method of the WMI namespace will be used here. Using this technique we can found the key hardware resource details. These are the details we are trying to find out using the WMI.  Motherboard Memory Hard disc & Logical Discs Network card BIOS Monitor Display Removable Drives Processor  Module 7: Software Details As in the above module, this module also totally relies on WMI.  Similar techniques will be used here to find out the details of software resources. But this doesn’t give accurate results as expected. WMI exposes only the resources that are active. Due to this reason, we can’t list out the software that is not actively running. In any case, we can find out the OS details, and other software which were running services on OS. The other software information installed on that system can be retrieved as and when that software is running. Another glitch here is not all software products support information exchange through WMI object. We may use Win32_InstalledSoftwareElement.Software namespace to optimize our search for installed software components. Module 8: Enumerating Running Processes & Controlling  In this module, we are going to bring out three different things as and when they are running. This doesn’t mean that SRC is going to watch these issues for every second. This certainly adds up the already running processes and becomes extra load on CPU diminishing its performance.  Processes Threads Handles  WMI object doesn’t give differentiated list of processes, threads and handles, instead it gives all in a pool. We should programmatically regroup all these. We may even go to the extent of finding the length of each process, or thread in terms of time. The CPU utilization for all these processes will be done in a separate module which will be detailed in Module 10 We are going to look at these issues, either at pre-defined intervals of time, and results will be logged for future reference or at the administrator click of a mouse button on the corresponding control. Of these the first option is not implemented in the current version, and is planned for the next release. Module 9: Memory Utilization  This and the next modules are extension of the previous module. These modules use the same objects of WMI along with additional CIMV2 classes and namespaces to find out the memory and its utilization. Generally, we will display the selected systems memory details under the following heads.  Page File  Total Size In Use In Use (Max) Free   Physical Memory  Total Available   Virtual Memory  Total Size In Use In Use (Max) Free   Totals  Processes Threads Handles    This detailed structure of memory utilization will help the network administrator to find out the optimum utilization of memory. He can also control the memory leaks when some unnecessary processes, handles or threads are consuming extra chunks of memory by killing those. These killing processes, handles and threads will be dealt in same module but under another sub module. Module 10: CPU Utilization  To find out the CPU utilization, we don’t require any separate WMI object. As said earlier, we can use the Module 8’s objects with little tweaking. We are going to exploit the CIMV2 sub classing options here. In general, CPU will be used only to do one or the other kind of processing. All these processes can be listed out using the Module 8’s functionality. If we finds out each process, thread or handle’s CPU utilization along with its memory utilization, we can have total and averages of CPU utilization at any given point of time. Module 11: Broadcasting & Sending Messages  These are the simplest tasks of the SRC project. There is nothing we need to do great programming to perform broadcasting and sending messages to groups of systems or even individual systems. We can simply use the system calls (nothing but system network related API calls). Module 12: Log Off, Reboot, & Shutdown Module 13: Saving the Results Module 14: Graph Display (*) Module 15: Reports (*) Conclusion The project undertaken is useful for Controlling of System resources. Useful for maintaining system integrity, functionality and  to increase performance of the system. By the Use of VB.net process for execution makes it easier to work with and also it a very user interactive.            "
183,http://1000projects.org/special-notepad-net-project.html,special notepad net project.," ABSTRACT: Special Notepad is an Application which is advance of notepad and better looking app and we can install this on our system. This is a better looking App or product .And this may give a very nice working support to the user who want to work in betIen multiple file. And I can write the file or edit the file on this Special Notepad.           This special notepad has three tabs which names are Writing Pad, Painting Paper and Image Notes.The Image Notes tab helps  us to easily write the text from the image.The Painting Paper tab helps us for demonstration. The Writing Pad tab helps us to open multiple file in different tabs. Future modification & Update In future I will attach database with special notepad for the purpose of storing files into the database. Which database can only allow the user who should correctly signed in. Using the above objective of Visual Studio 2005, A complete code for aprogram can be wriiten. PROPOSED SYSTEM The proposed system for this special Notepad, would allow uses to work or write the files using this application. PROJECT DESCRIPTION This Special Notepad project has the following modules:  Notepad with more options Multitabs in single form Ribbon menu Calculator Painting Paper Image Viewer Setup file creation   DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT Notepad with more options This Module may also contains same amount of options which are appears in our ordinary Notepad. And then more option included with this App or project or product.  Because to give more facility to the user to improve the quality of the file. Multiple Tabs within the single form  Using more than one tab with in a single frame or form to give a more comfortable to the users. And the single tab has a eligibility to show a complete file at a time. Then multiple tabs may also be shows the more files at a time using in single form. For example: Comparing both files which are important to relate and to solve the problem or to find the solution by referring the both files at a time, error correction…etc.   Ribbon menu in Notepad  Today market trend is to improving the better looking quality, stylist form or frame creation to cover the customer or users of product.   So like that Microsoft introduces the ribbon menu to the programmers and developers to add in our project or product to improve the software quality.   Finally in the same way I am also going to improve my project quality. So I am going to use one of the special thing (which is ribbon menu) with is updated by Microsoft.   I am used Ribbon menu to operate the over all options of main form  For sample options are: new file creation, save, save as, exit, copy, Calculator, paint Form, Image Form also. CALCULATOR   In this calculator have same arithmetic options like an ordinary Calculator with good looking.   And operation of arithmetic calculator will be appears in a separate new form.  PAINTING PAPER: The reason of painting paper adding into the special Notepad is to create a main map of which I understand by the file  use: if a teacher may have working on Special Notepad, If he want to like to explain or teach clearly in the way of graphical wise, then he or she may also be used the Painting paper.  IMAGE VIEWER: The Special Notepad has one more special thing which is Image Viewer. This image viewer may also shows already stored images.  Use: if the user or the teacher want to show or explain by using the image, which is already stored in the selected path.  About : SETUP FILE  In this project, I am will show how to deploy a C# application using a standard Visual Studio Setup Project. Any application must be somehow provided to the end-user. If the application is very small and is composed of a single executable, it can be deployed by just providing the executable to the end user so there is no need to create a setup project.   If I may have composed the multiple executable then setup creation is a one an only way to escape by the file missing there is no duplicate.   And one more main reason is I can safely and secretly give or present or sale our project to the end user or customer. So I can hide our logical coding and special files. This method is apply to every project which are in App market.   So finally our main reason is created setup project can’t be depend or present on any client machine to execute the specified function, so I need to create a setup project, that will install the needed dependencies and the application itself.  SNAP SHORT  And next one tab of special Notepad is Painting Paper   Save File DialogBox generated by Button of Ribbon Menu to store  ADDING TabPages  Here Page: 3 and Page:4 are newlyadded tabPages. By the reflection of +tab button at ribbon button Deleting Tabpages  And then, This is the figure of after delectedtabpages 3 and 4 by clicking the -tab of RibbonMenu. This is a font Dialog Box for selected tabPage.  PrintDialogbox for print the file  ColorDialogbox for changing the BackgroundColor of selected tabpage.  Following those are the some basic and improtant operations of notepad to easily handlethe copy paste operation. The Keys are Cut,Copy,Paste,SelectAlland finally TextToSpeech recognizerbutton.  CONCLUSION This Special Notepad Application is a great improvement over the system user. The Visual Studio has good human attraction. In the current system, the front app using is very slow. The user can work with this application reliably. ADVANTAGES  Notepad with more options Multitabs in single form Calculator Painting Paper Image Viewer Setup file creation(installable)             "

Classes and controls used in Assembly Decision tool  Open file dialog control: This control is used to open a file in the system. Menu strip control: This control is used to set the all the desired fields on the top of the menu bar. Tool tip control : It is used to bind the values or buttons to the menu strip control ( For ex in if we take file menu when we click on this a drop down list comes and we have open file, save file all this comes under this tool tip control) Print Document: It is used to print the document. Print Dialog: This control is used to display a dialog box that enable user to print option for the user. Status strip: Display info to the user about the object viewed, object components (here we use this control for progress bar).    frmSave.cs  Tool tip: Used to display info when mouse moves a pointer over an associate control. Save file dialog: It displays a dialog box that promotes a user to select location for saving a file.    FrmSettings. Cs   In this form we use tool tip control.       frmZoom.cs  Here we use menu strip.  Classes used in this project:  File info: This class provides instance method to create, delete, and opening file. For this he is passing open file dialog as a parameter after this he is calling the garbage collector to collect the us. In process file he process the file using DotNetObject class. In dot net object class is used to check weather the given dll is system type or not. Background worker: This class is used to execute an operation on separate thread. In this class he wrote the background color of the page, this is executed when the page is loaded. Draw Diagram: Here we should assign a tree view node to tree view control and we should call render panel control in render panel, write code such if there is at least 1 required class for diagram or select them all. He created list and to that he getting all the classes which are to be drawn, get the list of all drawable classes from the static method Namespace.cs, and create a new panel, add these drawable class control one by one to panel. Final after completing show panel. Zoom: in this class we use the Bitmap classes. In Bitmap class we use the get Bitmap For Control method in this he is getting all the classes need to draw height,width of the diagram and return the bitmap type after get this the user assign the value to the frmzoom Currentimage. Save Diagram: Here the user provides different types of save options like .gif, .bmp etc.., which Image Format should now be used, we have to write a code. Then he assigns all formats to imgformat object and calls the garbage collector. Save the image, however if we are saving the image to the save file name the Bitmap object maintains a lock on the physical file, so we need to use another dummy Bitmap to hold the original image, so that the lock creates by the original image saving process can be released, then we can save the dummy Bitmap contents back to the original image and conduct the save.  Then he calls the render plan to build the list of the class then he save the image.   Print: in this he is using the getBitmapForControl method in this method in this method he is assign the height, width ,background color pnl set Location and size then he is calling renderpanel () method to build the list of class to be drawn then he is calling some event handler with passing the parameter as the bitmap image then he print the image with the help of printer controls Exit: Here the user exist from the application, he is using the static class concept Settings:Here he is calling the process file method he check there it’s a valid clr type or not and it’s a system type Show or Hide:Here the user if its true the treeview control should be shown here the form resize should be done with resize method Help: Here we are calling the From about c\form that is a static form  Assembly Dissection Tool Assembly Dissection Tool dll Assembly Dissection Tool Student Manager Assembly Dissection Tool Student Manager Functions            "

186,http://1000projects.org/flex-based-web-ms-sql-explorer-net-project.html,flex based web ms sql explorer net project.," Scope of the Project: This Flex Based Web Ms Sql Explorer application web database explorer aims to increase the scope of database administration by building the remote administration tool to interact with sql server located over the web. The main scope of the project is to build a website that gives access to the Microsoft sql server over a web. So that, the user can perform all type of operations such as creating the tables, retrieving and updating the database tables, deleting the rows and modifying the tables etc. Brief Description of the Project:           Administrators are typically among the people most highly trained in solving the database issues at a side , the improvements in normal sql explorer allows valuable resource to spend more time working on database design and application data access issues. The scope of database administration of such complex task is still limited to the desktop over a LAN network where the server is installed in a single system, which acts as a server, and the other systems as client work under the client environment to interact with the sql server. The client systems which are connected to server over a LAN network can access the Microsoft sql server and database tables by using the username and password provided by the administrator, which is already exists. But now, we are developing a web application which access to Microsoft sql server over a web. The user can access this web application from anywhere from any remote location whatsoever at the same time maintaining the security aspects. In order to overcome the problem of installing the Microsoft SQL software in every user system and to reduce the repetitive work of the database administrator, our project provides a Web address to access the Microsoft SQL server by all the web users. And we provide a username and password to the user to access the server with security over the web.  Features of this project are:  Reduces the repetitive work performed by the database administrators. Improves the normal SQL explorer. Maintains security for SQL server similar to enterprise manager. No need of installation of the SQL software in every user system. Reduces the time for access. Enhances security. Can be extended to other software making it a remote freeware.   Software Requirements:  Microsoft .Net framework. Microsoft ASP.Net . Microsoft C#.Net language. Microsoft Visual Studio Internet Information Services (IIS). Flex Builder Microsoft SQL Server  Class Diagram Sequence Diagram for Entered or Selected Text Use case Diagrams Modules Description of the Project Databases Access Module: In this module user can access the database by giving credentials like username, password and database name to which database he wants to connect. Once we connect to the database then we can able to manipulate tables, views and stored procedures. And we can execute the select commands with the query parser. Object Browser: After validation user can view all the tables, views and stored procedures in the accessed database. Tabbed Query Windows:  Application provides tabbed query windows to execute the commands with the query parser. User can open several query windows and execute the queries.  User can execute the queries like selecting, updating, altering stored procedures etc,. Query Result Windows: After execution of a query result will be displayed in result window, any messages displayed in messages window and any history related to that query will be displayed in history window. Syntax Highlighting: Syntax will be highlighted while writing query in query window. Table Operations: User can insert new values into table and modify the table structure. Insert and modify user interfaces will be provided to user like we have it in enterprise manager.     FUTURE  ENHANCEMENT: Presently this project works only for Sql Server database only, in future this project can be implemented for other databases also. As a future enhancement we are planning to implement this project not only for database administrators but also for other users like employees in organization            "

In this application all the best offers present in the site are displayed to users. In this site users can be of 3 types 1)user 2)Registered user 3)Advertiser. User can just view the offers present in the site and can also view best offers and the offers which will dispose in short time.           Register users can have all the capabilities like user and in addition he is registered with the site and can even give rating to the offer and can search for the ad’s Advertiser can login into the site and can place an add related to him. Advertiser as to register before he can login into the site.  Use Case Diagram for the Advertiser Use Case Diagram for the registered user Introduction Myoffers is mainly an advertising web application. this is the application which is developed for having all the advertisements in one place where users or customers can see all the ad’s in one web application and come to know all about the products. In this application all the best offers present in the site are displayed to users. Purpose  The purpose of the project is to develop a web application which can make customers view all the offers under one site and can make users know where he can get the best offer for the product he wants and help other customers by giving rating to the best offers present in the city.    In this website helps customers or user by getting all types of products by different outlets under one roof. This site shows the best offers present in the site and the offers which are about to dispose are also displayed.  Scope This system only shows which offer is running in which shop(advertiser) in city or who are registered with our site not all the offers present across the city. In this system user has to register with our site to give rating to a particular ad or offer. Normal user does not have all the facilities such as registered users.  Goals :  The Goal of the project is to develop a web application which can make customers view all the offers under one site and can make users know where he can get the best offer for the product he wants and help other customers by giving rating to the best offers present in the city. The customer can bookmark the best add so that when he log’s in he can get the best ad’s according to him Features of our project (Advantages)  Customers can know the best offers in the city Can know best offer of a particular product from different outlets so customer can choose which offer is best for him Customer can rate the offers which may help the other customers  System Analysis Existing System                               Generally customers know about the offers of the product or a brand through different ways like seeing in newpapers , hoardings etc. There is no site which gives information about all the products and all the brands in a single site. Users or customers have to log in into particular brand website to know all about the products and it’s offers.                       Proposed system: In our website customer can check all the offers of all the products and all the brands posted by different advertisers at one place and can know the best offers present in the city. Can compare the offers of same brands with different advertiser’s and can choose the best. Customer or registered user can give rating to a particular ad if he likes it. Can also see the best offers posted by advertiser at one place. And the offers which are getting disposed soon can also be seen at one place Functionalities:  User Restaurant Manager Advertiser Super Admin  Overall description In our website customer can check all the offers of all the products and all the brands posted by different advertisers at one place and can know the best offers present in the city. Can compare the offers of same brands with different advertiser’s and can choose the best. Customer or registered user can give rating to a particular ad if he likes it. Can also see the best offers posted by advertiser at one place. And the offers which are getting disposed soon can also be seen at one place Super Admin: Super Admin unique id’s to the advertisers of various Shopkeepers .After giving id’s to the advertisers, the advertisers can login With their username and password and can provide information regarding the Offers they were present in their shop with complete details regarding the product which includes the product name, product category, actual price, offer price, to date & from date. After the advertiser provides the information regarding the product and before it is being published in the site it will be verified by the super admin and then it will be published. Super admin purpose is to validate the information and to provide only valid information to the users. Advertiser: Advertiser purpose is to publish the information regarding the products in their shop with complete details. He advertises the original price and also the discount price for which the user can purchase it. He provides the information regarding each and every item on which he have provided offer so that the user can select their best choice. He advertises the period of time that the particular item will be under offer. Restaurant Manager: Restaurant Manager Will Add the All Restaurant Information by city Wise And Add the Amounts. User : Users are of two types registered users and normal users. Registered users first need to register in to the site; if they are already registered they can login in to the site with their username and password so that they view the best offers regarding the products that were present in the particular shop. Once they view the products and their details then they will have a clear idea about the product, so that the user can go to the particular shop and buy the product. Normal users who are not registered ones can’t access all the information of the product; they can just view the products but complete details will not be provided. CONCLUSION Hence from this software the Employees will be able to login with their Respective Username and password then enter their Expenses with the respective receipts, and then send mail to the manager, Once manager received the mail from the Employees, then he will verify the Bill s claimed by the employees and he can approve or reject the bills, if he reject the bill he send a mail to that particular employee why he is rejecting that particular expenses. If he accepts that expense claimed by the employee then he send the details to the next level, in the next level can be the director or the chair person of the Organization. Once the head person accept the reimbursement, the he send the details to the account related department for credit that much amount to the particular person. This way we have created very user friendly and effective software which is not only helpful to an employee but also to every other person in the company using dot net.            "
188,http://1000projects.org/code-converter-vb-net-project.html,code converter vb net project.," Overview Dot Net has a great boom in the present scenario due to its advantages like platform independent and language independent. Language independent is a major added advantage in .Net which helps developer to code in his known language and then compile it and execute it. Likewise after completing all the modules they made into one application by joining all those modules. Think over it,it is easy isn’t? Now if the developer has to go through the code which is developed in another language then here problem arises ,i.e, the coding language cannot be understood by him. This project helps the user to convert a particular language code into another language code. And complete files in one language can be converted into another language code. Purpose           Instantly we can convert one language of .Net into another language. In this project we are trying to convert VB code into C# code and vice versa. Scope As of now we are dealing with only two languages of .Net.  C# net  Features The main features of this project are as follows: Converting one language code into another language is the basic aim of this project. This conversion is been implemented basically in two different languages that is the converting the code into C# to VB and vice versa. If we consider the inner logics then converting certain lines of code from C# to VB and vice versa and also converting set of files directly from C# to VB and then saving the converted files into the desired location. The idea behind this project is to help out the persons who want the code in another language where in the person doesn’t have any knowledge about that language. This helps the person to save lot of time that is the time for learning the language and then implementing the code is very hectic job.  Existing System In the existing system we will not find any software or application where one language code can be converted directly into different language code. This makes the developer to look for a system which can convert one language code into another language code which helps the person in saving his valuable time that is in the present scenario if the user has to code a project in another language then he should learn the language code and then implement the project code or else he has to take the help of a person who knows the language. This makes the major drawback and the user may not find any other alternative for this process.  Software Architecture  Problem Statement The main motivation idea for this project is of converting one language code to another language. But in the present scenario we will not find any application which will convert one language code to another. So by analyzing the drawback in the existing system we are trying to implement a application where in it directly converts one language code into another. Presently we are trying to implement with two different languages i.e., with C# and VB.  Proposed System Considering the drawback in the existing system we are developing a converter where one language code can be converted to another language code and even one language project code to another language code. This helps the developer a lot in analyzing the code and reduces the time for converting one language code to another language code. Advantages  Converting code from one language into another language Reduces time in converting the code Helps the user to implement the code in multiple languages without the knowledge of another language.  SYSTEM REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION  Hardware Requirement  P4 and above RAM 1GB and above Hard disk 40GB and above  Software Requirements  Microsoft Framework 3.5 Microsoft C# 3.5 Microsoft Visual Studio2008IDE.   Project Description    Let us consider the scenario where in for developing the larger application they divide the projects into modules   so that the complexity of the project reduces. If one particular module is easy to be done in one particular language then one group can proceed in that language and if another group with another language they can do their module in that language. Likewise after completing all the modules they are made into one application by joining all those modules. Suppose   the developer has to go through the code that is developed in another language then here the problem arises as that coding language cannot be understood by him. This project helps the user to convert a particular language code(C#) into another language code(VB).Even the project files(C#) in one language code can be converted into another language code(VB).In the existing we don’t find any converters . .Net   is language independent, if the team has multiple skill expertise C#, VB.net, developers can still work on the project with different skill set. Not every project is same we can create a lists of programs and convert them in one click. Thus with the use of .Net code converter with great ease we can convert the language codes. Modules Description The system after careful analysis has been identified to present with the following modules. Convert s C# to VB (Statements) The user gives set of C# statements as input. In this module these lines will be converted into VB statements and shows the converted lines as output. Converts VB to C# (Statements) The user gives set of VB statements as input. In this module these statements are into C# and these converted statements forms the output. Convert Files From C# to VB The user gives set of C# files as input and selects the destination path where the converted files are to be saved. The application will convert the given files into VB and then saves it in the selected location. Convert Files From VB to C# The user gives set of VB files as input and selects the destination path where the converted files are to be saved. The application will convert the given files into C# and then saves it in the selected location.  Output Screens: Code in VB (Statements)  Converted Statements in C#:  Opening a file directly:  Getting the content into the page:  Converted Statements:  Showing Error Message:  Saving the file:  Saved File content:  Converting C# to VB:  Giving the content as input:  Converted Statements: Giving File Content Directly:  Reading the content in the file: Converted Statements: Saving the changed code into new file: File in VB: Converting Set of Files: Giving Folder as Input:  CONCLUSION In this project we have achieved converting one language code to another language code where in if the user gives code of one language then this project converts it into another language and then gives the converted code as output. This is been implemented for converting from C# to VB and VB to C# language codes. This is of two parts i.e., converting set of statements and giving the converted statements as output and converting set of files directly and saving the saved files in the user desired location and as well if there are any errors in conversion then the errors will also be shows as the syntax is concerned. FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS  Adding future requirements is not about requirement management, rather it is about features that are identified during requirement analysis, which are not planned to be developed but it is anticipated that they will be developed as future enhancements. Describing such requirements is beneficial, especially when it is identified that these future requirements influence the overall architecture of the solution, so that addressing such requirements can be noted and integrated later. Following are the future enhancements that can be realized in the time to come:  Converting the one language code into the desired language i.e., any OOPs supportable languages. If the project is given as input then converting the complete project code of one language code into another language along with the designs in the project.              "

190,http://1000projects.org/multi-point-multi-section-order-based-serving-system-modern-restaurant.html,multi point multi section order based serving system modern restaurant.," OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT In the present scenario the current process of serving the customers in a restaurant is by taking the orders manually which are selected from the menu card and further placing the order in the kitchen wherein the master chef makes the other cooks to prepare the items accordingly whenever the customer wishes to order for the new item then again the same procedure repeats, finally this whole process has certain problems like including lot of man power. Evaluating this scenario we are trying to develop an application where the man power is reduced by implementing the touch screens wherein the order can be placed by just touching the required items/menu on the screen, the session continues until the customer wishes to pay the bill. There are three main modules in the system they are central administration system, user/table terminal and kitchen terminal. ARCHITECTURE           Multipoint and multisection order based serving system is a 2 tier architecture where as the presentation and business logic will be in one layer and the database interaction will be in other layer. SQL Server2005 is used as backend storage and ASP.NET is used for presentation layer. C#.NET is used to write the entire application code. TECHNOLOGIES USED We have used Microsoft’s .NET Technologies: ASP.NET 2.0, C#.NET 2.0, AJAX Extensions (version for .NET 2008). For database, sql server2005 is taken as backend. PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT Our Modern Restaurant System is a software application which can be implemented by providing touch screen facility that puts your business at your fingertips and makes it easy, too. This software enables the customer to view the menu card on the touch screen and order the items by himself with the touch of the finger on the screen. SCOPE OF THE PROJECT The main scope of the Multi Point and Multi Section Order Based Serving System in a Modern Restaurant project is to overcome the following consequences of Delay in serving, Misconception of order, More requirement of manpower which are the most common disadvantages existing in present situations. Avoiding these leads to the benefits of more number of customers, reducing the erroneous data entry, give the customers what they actually want and improving customer’s satisfaction, fast billing procedures.  SYSTEM ANALYSIS EXISTING SYSTEM In this system the customer is given a menu card from which he needs to select the items and orders are noted down by the waiter manually. Then the waiter submits this order to the kitchen head, who instructs the chefs. On the request of the customer for the bill, the waiter informs the cashier to generate the bill and gets back the bill to the customer for payment. Due to this there are many drawbacks such as : a. Delay in serving b. Misconception of order c. More requirement of manpower. To avoid all these we will switch to Modern Restaurant System. PROPOSED SYSTEM Our MRS is an innovative solution for restaurants which can create craze among the youngsters. MRS is a windows based application developed in .Net. This application is concerned with 3 modules: 1. Back Office 2. KPS 3. User Terminal This software enables the customer to view the menu card on the touch screen and order the items by himself with the touch of the finger on the screen.  Also he can know the amount he need to pay. When the customer feels to receive the bill he can just close the session so that the bill will be generated at the server end and also it will be displayed on the table screen. Orders entered by the customer at the client station automatically display at the cooks station, increasing the speed with which orders can be prepared and decreasing the wasted time of servers walking back and forth to the kitchen! When the customer closes the session, the order information along with the bill details automatically send to the server where the bill is generated avoiding misconceptions in the bill. SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: a) OPERATING SYSTEM : Window XP b) LANGUAGE : C#.Net c) WEB TECHNOLOGIES : ASP.NET d) SERVER  : ISS-5.0 Architecture: Usecase diagram for the entire modules: Sequence diagram for admin:  sequence diagram for kitchen terminal  sequence diagram for table terminal: collaboration diagram for kitchen terminal collaboration diagram for admin: collaboration diagram for user terminal: ER-Diagram:  A new technique has been introduced to automate the ordinary serving system in a restaurant. Use of touch screens will save lot of time of all the customers visiting the restaurant for placing their orders and also the servers for delivering the orders without any time lapse. This application reduces human effort to a very large extent because the customer need not wait for the waiter to come and take his order and then after finishing his order he does not manually request to pay the bill, automated billing is enabled where he can pay the bill easily by a simple finger touch on the screen. Misconception of the waiters in serving the orders will also be reduced to wider extent because the orders are correspondingly displayed on kitchen screen and respectively served in FIFO basis. Touch equipment is durable for longer time; even if they wear out after a period of time they can be easily replaced and maintained using the modern technology trends. This innovative technology thereby improves the customer satisfaction and also leading to profits by serving more number of orders in less period of time. FUTURE SCOPE As future works, we want to focus on three major issues. Firstly, a gateway can be enabled for secured authentication purpose when the bill payment is made by the customer using the credit card or debit cards. Next, the registration page for the user can be designed not only in English but also in other regional languages using corresponding software so that this application will be more user friendly. Finally, a particular id can be assigned to each and every user when he first time visits the restaurant his information will be stored in the database and when he again visits the restaurant next time if he logs in using this id he can enjoy further benefits provided by the restaurant.

It is general tendency for any human being to overlook few words or sentences while going through articles which may lead to any kind of mistake based on the importance of the article or document that he/she is going through.           The idea of the iSpeak project is built, based on the recent enhancements taken place in Internet Explorer [IE8] from Microsoft Corporation. In IE8 user has a provision of searching a text by selecting a search keyword from the present website page he/she is in. This Idea made us to think of this project, which we call them as Next Generation Speech applications. The main Idea of the present iSpeak – Next Generation Application is when the users are surfing through an article in Internet Explorer; we wanted some one to speak for the user instead he /she going through entire article. For that we wanted to build a new concept of select and speak in IE. This is purely research and development in this area.  Moving further this idea can be implemented across all the browsers which we wanted to define as Future scope of the project. Along with this, if the users wanted to read any kind of document such as .txt, .doc, .PDF we wanted to build a desktop utility to read entire/selected portion of the text for him/her. In the initial stages of Research and development we will be starting with one voice and later we try to implement different types of voices [Male and Female] with different ages. Even we want our project to support saving those selected/Entire file as wav format so that user can listen to the article whenever he/she wants instead of searching. Modules & Functionalities in this Project: The following are modules /functionalities of the projects.  Reading selected text of Website in IE  When ever user selects some text and commands the IE then our application need to speak out the selected text. Even user can have a provision of saving the same text to Database for future reference.    Speak module Saving to Database module    Practical applicability: Read all your emails in IE, white papers, articles, encyclopaedias etc  Documents reader module  In this module user can upload any kind of document [.Txt, .Doc, .PDF ] to listen to the text in the document. Even the application should be able to handle selected text reading.  Document Reader Saving to Database module Selected text reading functionality   A desktop application is build to search for all the saved documents for future reference. Different voice compatibility  We are trying to make this application compatible for different voices [Male and Female.]  Different age groups compatibility  We are trying to make this application compatible for different age groups too.  Converting selected text to Wav format for further reference.   Technologies used:  Microsoft .Net C# 2005 or above SQL server 2005 or Above  Type of Project: Research and Development. Note:  This ISpeak project is under Research and Development so, there could be much number of features coming as and when we explore it. We may have to modify the abstract slightly.

195,http://1000projects.org/network-intrusion-detection-system.html,network intrusion detection system.," This lacks standard interface for the low-level interaction. The characteristic affects the portability of used can be categorized as an ordinary system that can be used to detect only a known or ungeneralised set of users. The main drawback lies in the fact that the system cannot be generalized. The system acts as a subsystem of the firewall itself.  The system contains the details of the intruder, which is then forwarded to the firewall.  Drawbacks           The system has no access to the data in the packets. The existing system only checks with the IP address of the arriving packets. It is possible to identify the intruder with the IP address and not with the contents of the packet. It sometimes happens that the data arrive with data that has the capability of hacking the information from the network. This is possible using certain keywords. The existing system fails to detect such intrusion. The existing system is a faster one as far as the performance is considered.   Benefits  The most important feature of the system is that the system can generalize the type of intrusion. Large amount of checking has to be done in the packets with the data stored in the adaptive model database. Software Configuration: FRONT END:           VB.NET BACK END:           MS SQL SERVER The output forms are: – Intruder details display Form. Adaptive modal display Form. IP request Form. Port scanning Form. Ping Machine Form TCP sniffing Form. UDP sniffing Form. All packet sniffing Form Packet Detection Form Data Mining Form Active Machine Form Instance Management Form Instant Message Form Reports Form. Input forms are: – Login Form. Change Security Form. Intruder registration Form. Intruder alteration Form. Adaptive modal registration Form. Adaptive modal modification Form. Locking Form. CONCLUSION: The project ‘Network Intrusion Detection System’ is meant for providing security to a system by forwarding the validated packet details to the firewall. The current system has four modules. Registration     : To register intruders and data model details. Sensor : For capturing raw data packets. Detector          : Detection of the intruder packet and forwarding packets to the firewall for blocking. Options           : Monitoring certain system details by the administrator. The administrator, who is the only user, can monitor all the network traffic that is the packets arriving into the network filtering the protocol type that is whether the packet is TCP or UDP. The administrator can also find out which all are the intruder packets and can forward the message for blocking the packets to the firewall. Considering the current trends and the developments the future might offer, this is a secure system with a promising bright future in the coming networking era.

It is used to sniff out the network packets. It helps to increase packet throughput as inspecting every packet can slow traffic considerably. It is an essential tool that compliments any security suite such as firewall and a good antivirus. Large amount of checking has to be done in the packets with the data stored in the adaptive model. The system uses up LAN bandwidth. It has double the total network bandwidth requirements from any LAN. The system is more adaptable to cross platform environments.            The important modules of the system are:   Admin Detection Monitor Remote Control Utility Recovery Service  Admin: Administrator registers the intruder’s known IP addresses and  the harmful data. Detection: Packets are detected comparing the IP address and data table. Monitor: Pinging and shortest path is found. Remote Control: Shut down, Restart and log off activities are done. Utility: Change password, locking the application in server system  and Sending messages is done. Recovery service: Backups of the data running in client machine is maintained. INTRODUCTION NETWORK ADMINISTRATOR ASSISTING TOOL  The project named “Network Administrator Assisting Tool” is a system that not only detects the intruders by IP address; it detects the system with its contents also. It is used to sniff out the network packets. It helps to increase packet throughput as inspecting every packet can slow traffic considerably. Large amount of checking has to be done in the packets with the data stored in the adaptive model. The system uses up LAN bandwidth. It has double the total network bandwidth requirements from any LAN. The system is more adaptable to cross platform environments. Aim: The proposed system can be used to attain information relating to network. It can be used to retrieve the information regarding the current systems in the network, the ports in use, locking the system etc. The system is first fed in with the currently available intruders and the kind of data that are to be kept out of network. Information once is stored into the system is used to check the data packets. The IP addresses that are registered are forwarded to the firewall once found among the packets. The case is different with the adaptive modal. The unwanted type of data that are stored in the adaptive modal database is compared with the data that is passing through the network. On finding any packet that contains any of the contents of the adaptive modal database they are registered as intruders and the information is stored in the database.   SOFTWARE SPECIFICATION  Platform: Windows 2000/XP GUI Tool: API Environment: C#.NET Database: Microsoft® SQL Server™ 2000 SYSTEM STUDY  DETAILED STUDY The most important feature of the system is that the system can generalize the type of intrusion.

On finding any packet that contains any of the contents of the adaptive modal database they are registered as intruders and the information is stored in the database.   EXISTING SYSTEM Drawbacks of existing system  The existing system does not provide proper security over the network. It needs manual processes to stop the intruder. Administrator has to be in front of the system all the time. Since the existing system does not have any details about the hosts, an unauthorized access cannot be detected easily. The intruder cannot be found at appropriate time and blocked. The existing system does not use any shortest path algorithm, so that it takes a large amount of time to transfer data packets from one host to another. Cannot ensure whether the packet has been send are received at the destination. The server application can be used by an unauthorized user as the existing system does not provide the facility of locking the application. It does not provide activities such as shut down, log off and restart.   PROPOSED SYSTEM The project named “Network Administrator Assisting Tool” is done by using C#.NET as a Frontend and SQL Server as a Backend. This system compliments any security suite such as firewall and antivirus. The system not only detects the intruders by IP address; it detects the system with its contents also. The system checks the database for the already registered intruders. If found intruding, they are forwarded to the firewall for blocking. The firewall is responsible for the blocking of the packets. The proposed system can be used to attain information relating to network. It can be used to retrieve the information regarding the current systems in the network, the ports in use, locking the system etc. The system is first fed in with the currently available intruders and the kind of data that are to be kept out of network. Information once is stored into the system is used to check the data packets. The IP addresses that are registered are forwarded to the firewall once found among the packets. The case is different with the adaptive modal. The unwanted type of data that are stored in the adaptive modal database is compared with the data that is passing through the network. On finding any packet that contains any of the contents of the adaptive modal database they are registered as intruders and the information is stored in the database.  Benefits of proposed system:   User friendly Ease of access Fast retrievals Single point system administration and maintenance Added security to system Can be implemented in network Easy to mention an IP address.  DATABASE DESIGN The database design is a must for any application developed especially more for the data store projects. Since the chatting method involves storing the message in the table and produced to the sender and receiver, proper handling of the table is a must. In the project, login table is designed to be unique in accepting the username and the length of the username and password should be greater than zero. The complete listing of the tables and their fields are provided in the annexure under the title ‘Table Structure’. Admin Table Name                 :           Admin Purpose                       :           Maintain Host In formations and Login Details Table Structure            :    Field Data Type Length Description Key   Hip Var char 20 Host IP Primary   Hname Var char 20 Host Name    Passwd Var char 29 Pass word    Ltime Date/Time 10 Login Time    Ldate Date/Time 10 Login date     Adaptive Model Table Name                 :           Adaptive model Purpose                       :           Maintain Packet Informations Table Structure            :    Field Data Type Length Description Key   Hip Var char 20 Host IP Foreign   Tdata Var char 20 Type of data    Size Numeric 10 Size of data     Intruder Registration Table Name                 :           Intruder Registration Purpose                       :           Maintain Intruder Information Table Structure            :    Field Data Type Length Description Key   Iip Var char 20 Intruder IP Primary   Rtime Date/Time 10 Reg Time    Rdate Date/Time 10 Reg Date    Tdata Var char 20 Type of data     Intruder Blocking Table Name                 :           Intruder Blocking Purpose                       :           Maintain Intruder Blocking Informations Table Structure            :    Field Data Type Length Description Key   Iip Var char 20 Intruder IP Foreign   state Boolean 10 State     Backup Process Table Name                 :           Backup Purpose                       :           Maintain Backup data Table Structure            :    Field Data Type Length Description Key   Hip Var char 20 Host IP Foreign   Dip Var char 20 Dest IP    Tdata Var char 20 Type of data     Remoting Table Name                 :           Remote Purpose                       :           Maintain Remote Process Information Table Structure            :    Field Data Type Length Description Key   Hip Var char 20 Host IP Foreign   hname Var char 20 Host name    actionp Var char 20 Action perf    actiont Date/Time 10 Action time    actiond Date/Time 10 Action date     Monitoring Table Name                 :           Monitor Table Purpose                       :           Maintain Ping, Port scanning and Route Tracing Information Table Structure            :    Field Data Type Length Description Key   Hip Var char 20 Host IP Foreign   Dip Var char 20 Dest IP    Ctime Date/Time 10 Conn time    Cdate Date/Time 10 Conn date    Spath Numeric 10 Shortest path    Portno Numeric 10 Port number Primary    CODE DESIGN The code design should be such that with less amount of coding we can achieve more results. The speed of the system will be more if the coding is less. Whether the data in the system is usable and readable by the system is depending on the coding. In the project, the coding is being done such that proper validations are made to get the perfect input. No error inputs are accepted. In addition care is taken such that the data integrity and referential integrity is not violated in the database. Checking the username and password, non-acceptance of duplicate username is made properly. In addition, coding is designed such that concurrency avoidance of accessing the database, limited user access to the table is made perfect. The coding is designed such that the consumer can view only his complaints. OUTPUT DESIGN Output Forms are,   Intruder Details Display Form. Adaptive Modal Display Form. IP Request Form. Port Scanning Form. Ping Machine Form. TCP Sniffing Form. UDP Sniffing Form. All Packet Sniffing Form. Packet Detection Form. Data Mining Form. Active Machine Form. Instance Management Form. Instant Message Form. Report Form.  SYSTEM DEVELOPMENTS  The important modules of the system are:  Admin Detection Monitor Remote Control Utility Recovery Service  Admin In this module administrator registers the intruder’s known IP addresses and the harmful data. The full control for the system is in admin and in this module administrator can update the IP as well as the modal data of the intruder. Detection This module detects the packets and it schedules the packets as TCP and UDP packets. Then it checks the data packets and the IP address. If any intruder or harmful data is there the system detects it. Monitor It lists all the processes and the error that is occurring and stores it in the database. Pinging is done and shortest path is found. Remote Control In this module, Administrator can find out all the active machines in the network. Administrator can then perform remote control activities such as shut down, Restart and log off according to the need. Utility Administrator can do the utilities like change password, lock the application in server system, and sending messages to the network. Recovery service Administrator can take backups of data, which are running in the client machine. Whenever the data is needed the data can be recovered and also can schedule the time. CONCLUSION  The Remote Monitoring System project can be thus found to be useful in various applications in both home use as well as office use to detect unnoticed malpractices in our system. Thus it makes the user to be careful about the improper usage of his system thus enabling him to take appropriate actions to stop them. Hence he can have a control over his system even in his absence. Hence it provides a level of security to the administrator’s PC. Remote Monitoring System is a powerful monitoring and surveillance tool that is useful on all platforms. This project helps us in a networking environment to monitor and spy all the system in the network connection without knowing the user.            "

201,http://1000projects.org/software-personnel-management-system-in-vb.html,software personnel management system in vb.," The Software Personnel management system is highly unique, because of its distinguished activities and behavior. It sounds to be different, because of its classified nature. It starts right from the conception of an application and it covers up the entire life cycle till the customer’s problems are successfully handled. The management of this process and its required documentation proves to be challenging as it has many cases to concern. The special cases arise from this management system such as handling the customer’s problem in such a way that it can be clearly mapped to the development details in the database. In the existing system all the processing are done manually. These systems will have to maintain the data in a hard file. While searching any data it is too difficult to find those.           Maintaining too many data about the software in separate files are too complicated. Similarly, it is too difficult to maintain data for each and every activity. So, the time utilization will be more in the manual system. In order to overcome these problems we have to propose the system which overcomes the problem of the existing method. We have proposed a system that would modernize the activities of Software Personnel management system. The developed system would perform all the function of the manual system. Using this system we can save time and the operation will be performed with ease comparatively.   1.INTRODUCTION:           To analyze, Design and develop code for Software Personnel Management system using Rational Rose software and Visual Basic 6.0. PROJECT SCOPE: The main scope of the project is to provide the developing company to maintain an interface to store and access the project details and the respective customer associated with it along with the assignment details with regards to the team working on the project. OBJECTIVE: The main objective of designing and developing a Software Personnel Management system is to provide with a system which proves to be manually beneficial i.e., benefits the software developing company. The complete activities and the process right from projects inception to its successful delivery is incorporated in this system.  PROBLEM STATEMENT: Software personnel system is a real time application used in the developer’s day to day system. This is a database to store the project configuration that is specified by the customer and the software developed for it includes customer and developer requirements needed for the process. Here we assume ourselves as the developing company: 1.The company is the developer of the software and it contains the necessary information of the software such as requirements, time limit etc. 2. The customer provides the requirements to the company and requests a suitable solution system. The company is only responsible for developing the system out of the requirements of the customer. 3. The company mainly obtains the requirements from the customer and by analyzing it, prepares a requirements and feasibility documentation initially. 4. Then the company develops a software system that is apt for the integrated requirements and tests it within itself and by exposure to the concerned customer, and finally builds a complete a satisfactory solution.  SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:  Design Tool : Rational  Rose Software Front  End: Visual basic 6.0 Back End : MS-Access PROJECT DESCRIPTION:  Existing System: The existing system is the manual system.   The manual system is error prone.  It is time consuming.  It is very difficult for a person to produce report.  There are chances for manipulating the reports and changing it.  This system involves a lot of manual entries with the applications to perform the desired task. Limitations:  Data maintenance adopted by the present system is not accurate. Inaccurate result in case of duplicating, delay and inconsistency in reporting. Generating consolidated reports is more difficult in manual system and it may not be consistent. The transactions are very time consuming. There is no facility for the users to know whether the data is entered is valid or not.  This disadvantage is the major cause of errors in transaction. There is inconsistency in maintaining data’s. No global view ability of data’s. No chance of knowing other members sales daily. It is not user friendly.  Proposed System:  The proposed system is designed to eliminate the drawbacks of the existing system.  It is designed by keeping in mind all the drawbacks of the present system in order to provide a permanent solution to the problems.  The primary aim of the new system is to speedup process.  The report is prepared for the software personnals. The personnel code and software code are validated. Accuracy for all the data entered is maintained in the proposed system through validation and verification from all the files.  Verification of personnel code, software code, validation of records, etc., are performed with maximum accuracy.  In short, efficiency is established.  The advantages of this system are listed below,  User friendliness is the keyword for all the new software in the market.  The proposed system incorporates this concept into itself to guide the user. At every stage of data entry necessary comments and validation messages are provided to the user. The proposed system is also expected to reduce the amount of paper work involved.  The hard copies of only necessary documents need to be taken the rest can be avoided. Competitive environment is developed with the publications of other members of same level. Good communication is being held via mail options. Data’s are maintained accurately via daily submission of information details.   Need For Computerization:             The Project entitled “Software personnel management system” was not computerized previously.  In this system, the information about the software and the progress of personnels and the  movement of the products in the market cannot be noted easily. If these informations are needed we need to spend lot of time, money and energy. If the company’s turn over has to be increased then there is some need for experts ideas for that up to date information has to supplied this is quite impossible in the present system. If the company wants to inform some important meeting/decisions, this process should start before sometime before the actual happening. If some person are added this too has to be informed individually for that quite some money has to be spent. Reports cannot be created easily with much flexibility and with limited amount of time. The head of the company cannot sit at a place and maintain the records without much assistance. Data maintenance is quite tough when maintained manually. High level of data redundancy exists. MODULE EXPLANATION:  The project ”Software personnel management sytem” deals with the process of managing the software personnels of a company.  This project consists of many UML diagrams that are described below, • Use case diagram • Class diagram • Sequence diagram • Collaboration diagram • State chart diagram • Activity diagram • Component diagram • Deployment diagram • Package diagram The project can be explained diagrammatically using the following diagrams. USE CASE DIAGRAM The use cases are a set of scenarios to guide together by a common user goal. A scenario is the sequence of steps describing an interaction between a user and their system. List of employeeLoginCEOEmployee detailsDatabase DOCUMENTATION OF USE CASE DIAGRAM  The use case diagram in the software personnel management system illustrates the sequence of sequencing and describing an interaction between a CEO and a system. Login: This use case gives as entry to the CEO and the database. List of employee:  This will create the situation for the CEO to select particular employee from the available list. Employee details:  The CEO can able to view the details of the employee using this use case. CONCLUSION:  The system is developed for automating the activities involved in the software done by the personnel. The data maintenance and reports generated are compatible with the daily activities of the department. The main advantage of the system over the existing system is the increase in the speed of information retrieval since that data is maintained systematically and any type of information required for the end user of the system can be generated easily. This system is of vital use to the software personnel incharge, to the distributor and to the representative also.  They can very well know about the sales done by them on a particular day or a month, between dates, in an area,… Though “Software Personnel Management System ” is so designed that not much amendment is required.  This system has provisions for adapting to future enhancements.

202,http://1000projects.org/examination-information-system-eis-in-vb.html,examination information system eis in vb.," IDENTIFICATION OF NEED: PROCESS IN EXAMINATION BEFORE THE EVOLUTION OF THE EIS SYSTEM: The whole process starts from registration of the candidate for the exam. Registration contains information related to students like            Registration number Name Branch Year Exam Fee details…  After the registration is completed a list of students who have registered will be issued application forms. Filled up applications are sent to the university by the college exam cell incharges. Then after some time basing on those applications, STUDENTS details year-wise, branch-wise, regular/supply, subject-wise, are stored in the system. Students get the hall-tickets along with the details of exams they are appearing and the concerned dates.  Details of conduct of examination: The university in Net displays the timetable of examinations and by that the students are allowed to attend the examinations basing on the schedule.  STUDENT’s details date-of-exam-wise should be taken. Seating order-Arrangement: Seating arrangement depends on the number of students appearing for a particular exam and the capacities of the examination halls. Based on date of exam, Branch, Subjects, Years, Regular/Supp/Transfer => Number of students of each exam are sorted in order. Sorting Order: Based on date of exam, Branch, Subjects, Years, Regular/Supp/Transfer => Number of students of each exam are retrieved. Then they are sorted as explained below:  Students attending regular exam are followed with supplementary students (if any) attending the same exam. Supplementary students are further sorted in increasing order based on their current year of study. Each batch of students (reg/supp) are in turn sorted as below :  Regular students followed by lateral entry students (if any) and transfer candidates (if any). In this seating arrangement we have to consider various hall capacities like  24 36 74 48 (with combination in 24)  and in this seating arrangement process students can be arranged with or without combination. Combination of students can be made in a hall only when the subjects to which they are appearing are different. Depending on sets allotment we have to check for seating conditions like: No two members of same year and same set and same branch should sit adjacent (side by side or across) to each other. Sets Allotment: Question paper set allotment will be done for the sorted  students with the starting set number mentioned by the JNTU. Manually the set numbers are represented corresponding to their register number in the seating arrangement form. All the above data is fed into Excel sheet. Nominals and Additional Sheet Forms: After the seating arrangement nominal rolls and additional sheet forms will be generated for the respective exam halls from seating arrangement database . In nominal form we have the columns:  Register number with corresponding register number Set number Signature  In additional sheet form we have the columns:  Register Number Main sheet no. of student Number of additional sheets taken Signature  These nominal rolls and additional sheet forms provide further fields like : number of students in that hall, number of students present and number of students absent. The filled-up information in Nominal rolls will be manually verified by the invigilators and the chief superintend. Finally this information is again updated in absentees statements which is a D-FORM. D-Form: In D-form students list of a particular branch/exam are grouped according to set allotment done and this list is further sorted in order as per seating arrangement. The absentees for that exam in that list are obtained from nominal rolls and corresponding register numbers are manually rounded. Total number of students registered, number of students present in each set are further details provided by D-Form. RISKS INVOLVED IN EXISTING SYSTEM: Present system is time consuming and involves lot of paper work. The risks involved in present system are due to its manual effort of collecting required data and summarizing them for report generartion. Some of the risks involved in present system are:  Student can register only when he/she is eligible for that.  Ex: If the student has attendance less than required percentage then he is not eligible to register. Many conditions like these are being checked manually before registration, which is time consuming and error prone.  In allotting sets, if a mistake is done at a point, then this becomes cumulative and this may result in adverse consequences. By mistake, in D-Form if a student present is marked as absent, confusion occurs in evaluation process. If there is any need to retrieve any details, it may seem to be difficult to search manually.  There are many other risks involved that can be easily tackled by computerizing present system. PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION:  PROPOSED SYSTEM Examination Information System [EIS] is the computerized system. Which will automate all the process that is going on in the present system. The main aims for going to computerized system is  Fast processing Less paper work Robust Adaptable Intuitive Easy retrieval   Registration: This process starts from Registration process and in this registration we fill the details of the candidate like:  Name of the student Register number B-tech or M.C.A Year of study Regular / supplement  Just before getting registered the student is checked against enrollment database, attendance database, debar list,1f4 and many other databases. Thus only the eligible students can register. Based on the entered criteria, fees gets automatically calculated and fees slip gets generated. If there are any changes made in fee structure by JNTU, due to the flexibility provided they can be easily reflected back in fee calculation. The fee structure will be different for regular and supplementary.   As per present fee structure, if regular he/she should pay the total amount of Rs.815 and if it is supplement he/she should pay the amount of Rs.200 for every subject  and this should be verified against previous marks database.  Sets Allotment: We allot sets for the students with the starting set number mentioned by the JNTU people and programatically the sets will be allocated to the sorted students and forms will be generated accordingly. Seating Arrangement: After completion of set allotment we get into seating arrangement. The seating arrangement consists of with/without combination of students we have to check for conditions like no two members of same year and branch should sit side by side. There are varieties of seating arrangements:  24 36 74 48 (WITH COMBINATION)  By mistake, if the user chooses the same subject students for combination in the same hall, then the process restricts the user by giving a meaningful message. Depending on number of students we categorize them in that particular room selected and we will store the placing of the students in base database that will be useful for automatically generating two forms namely,  Nominal Rolls Additional sheet forms   D-Form:  D-form gives the whole details or status of the class, and the absentees will be marked with red color automatically by checking register numbers against absentees database. Total students are grouped automatically based on set allotment database and then the calculations like no. of students present, absent per set are done and reflected back in report. This D-form will be sent to JNTU examination cell to inform status of the student. FORMS     REPORTS:    CONCLUSION: The Student Enrollment System is aimed to automate examination system of a college. The total system, which was planned and designed to develop is vast in nature and functionality. The system is user friendly and intuitive and can be used even by novice users. Though there was much that can be developed apart from what has been attempted, there were number of occasions on which new thoughts about various aspects of the project have been projected by the observers of the project, the duration of the project was considered to be a limiting factor for curtailing further previews and implementations. The hope is that the project will be a major commercial product when the gaps leftover in the development are filled and a full-fledged project is built from the analysis and design that has been done during the project.

204,http://1000projects.org/health-and-social-organizations-information-portal.html,health and social organizations information portal.," Description of the project: This is an information portal which holds all the information regarding the events conducted by some social organizations (like NGO) and their registered volunteers. It is a website which acts as a platform between the charity/social organizations and the volunteers who participate in those events. As per the event requirement an organization sends a request to the website (like “an organization wants to launch a blood donation camp and needs a work force of total 30 members where 10 members are doctors and others are volunteers who take care of other things”).           Depending upon the requirement of the event one organization is going to launch the posts requests to some volunteers who are presently in inactive state (i.e., presently not involved in any other event). At this stage the request posted by the organizations will be in pending mode. This request will be pending till the volunteers required for the event are met. In case for the first time if the requirement is greater than the resources the admin sends this event information to some other volunteers. After the requirement is met a mail is sent to the concerned charity/social organization that their event has been approved and these are the people who will be participating in this event. In the same way a message is sent to all the people who have been selected for that event as volunteers. We also have a registration field for the new people who are willing to participate in the event as volunteers. Here we have two specifications for a new volunteer that is (a) knowledge transfer and (b) general volunteer. In detail: (a)               Knowledge transfer registration à this is a scenario for a volunteer who is a busy doctor but is really interested in helping or participating in an event so with his help we get some valuable information in the form of document, video and audio files. Which will be available for the users after the doctor approves the material prepared. (b)               General volunteer registration à this is a general volunteer registration scenario where a normal user and the doctor who is interested to participate in that event. Now it could be any of the above two ways new volunteers have registered they can login and view the events going to be launched and send their accepted views of participation. Only thing is that no volunteer can be assigned a new event if he is already under an event. Modules:   Admin module: In this module admin deals with the uploading of all the related information of a topic , selecting the volunteers, sending request to volunteers and organisations and accepting/rejecting response sent by them.  User module: In this module registers into the site and can access all the information related to the posted by the admin, replies to the request sent by the admin to attend as a volunteer for an event.(doctor can also be treated as a user when he is willing to attend as a volunteer to the Event).   Charity organisation module: In this module charity can post an event requesting n No. of people required to conduct an event. Gathers all the necessary information required to conduct an event. Messaging is done with the volunteers who are assigned to conduct an event.   Technical Environment:  Microsoft framework 2.0 Microsoft C# language Visual Studio 2005 IDE Microsoft SQLserver2005 Internet Information Services (IIS) Microsoft Windows 2000 Sp4 or higher Microsoft ASP.Net 2.0             "

211,http://1000projects.org/online-employee-transfer-application-system.html,online employee transfer application system.," The project “Online Employee Transfer Application system” is designed using Visual Studio .NET framework version 2.0. The coding language used is C#.Net  Objective of the project:           The aim of this Project is to perform the following operations:  Managing all the details of the employees. The details will include the name of the employee, no of the employee, designation of the employee, current location of the employee and etc. It is useful to the employee’s as well as higher administrator. Providing updates of vacancy positions. Administrator can always watch the transfer application details. It is user friendly interface to the employee and higher administrator. Easy to search:Search becomes easy based on the input provided. It requires less time: When a employee is searching for a vacancy position and apply for transfer in a manual process it takes much time, but when compared to our proposed system it takes less time because it gives the output based on the input i.e., searching for vacancy positions.  Previous methods: In the existing system there is no online application for transfer requests, the employee should write a letter and send it to the Higher Management. The entire transfer request system is manual. For example if we take education department, the power to transfer teaching staff was very difficult in the hands of the director. This concentration of power had been leading to procedural delays most applications sent through the Principals and the Deputy Directors through proper Channel never reached their destination. This problem was more severe by the high number of applications coming for being processed. Such a large number of requests for transfer by the teachers were not only becoming difficult but taking a long time through manual means. There were rising complaints about delays, centralization of power and oversight or extreme pain faced by the applicants. Project approach and motivation of the project:  We proposed new system where the entire system is made available online and evaluates transfer requests automatically. The proposed system display the vacant positions and their details(area, eligibility, post, and other information if any…)and allow the employees to submit their request along with required data for the vacant post through online. After receiving the requests the system will evaluate the request based on specific criteria set by the administration. This software saves a lot of time and reduces work process.            "

This application primarily useful for network administrator in companies.  Multi desktop Spying Project Modules: MODULES            Desktop capturing Remote application execution Remote system Lock Monitor and control the remote computer Import and Export RDP files.   Desktop Capturing The desktop image capturing module captures a remote system desktop upon request from the server/administrator. With the command from the server the client captures the desktop images by generating a print screen event. When the key press event is triggered the system captures the currently displayed information in the monitor and places it in the clipboard memory of the client system. Once the connection will be established the server can do all the activities in the client screen through the server system. They need not go the client system for any activities.  The next event is to convert the image in the clipboard memory into a “.Bmp” file format. The converted bit map image is saved in a specified path. After the capturing and conversion of the image the file is transferred to the server system and then the file is displayed.  Remote Application Execution This module in the serer will display all the application which can be executed in the client system. But this information can be fetched only when the connection between the server and the client is established. The application along with the path in the client system is displayed and a corresponding command button is displayed. So the users or the administrator can press the command button to run the corresponding application in the client system. The software is designed to have three applications.  Remote system Lock With this module the administrator can connect to the client and check if the system is being used by nay user, this can done by capturing the desktop image of the client system. Once if the system is found to be idle and not used by any users then the administrator can lock the remote system from his system. The system lock process is achieved by calling a windows application programmers interface function.            "

223,http://1000projects.org/inventory-maintenance-of-wedding-card-organization.html,inventory maintenance of wedding card organization.," Inventory Maintenance of Wedding card Organization:   The System is undertaken for the development of electronic maintenance of inventory of the organization who works as wholesale merchandise of wedding and varied types of cards. The information related to enterprise such as transportation details, sales details, purchase details, dealers details, are maintained manually on paperwork. It becomes overhead for the entrepreneur of organization to maintain this entire task manually and to generate report & analysis of any activity on demand. So the demand for electronically maintaining this all task under single head had gave rise to the development of this system.  The process of organizational workflow goes in following way:-  Transportation Company provides the goods to the proprietor of the organization, sent by the manufacturers. The organization keeps details of transportation. The parcels are kept in the go down where the details of inward goods are maintained. The details of inward goods are maintained by organization from the bill (invoice) from dealers/manufacturers. The single invoice contains details for more than one item. The organization after recording the details of inward invoice assigns a unique identification to each card/ product and also the sale price. The organization sale this goods on retail and wholesale basis to their customers. Customers of this organization are printing press firms and common people as it is wedding card organization. Additionally the organization also maintains the current stock of organization by deducting sold stock from purchase stock. Organization also maintains personal details of dealers and customers for their reference purpose.  Scope           As the system maintains the inventory of a commercial organization of sole proprietorship, its bound is up to the entrepreneur of the firm. The owner of the business maintains all the task of maintaining details about transportation, purchase, sales, stock and personal information of dealers and customer as well. We can extend this system by portioning stock into two parts. I.e. stock on shop and stock in go down. And e-mail will automatically send to customer s about their purchases and dealers about the confirmation of receiving goods successfully. Requirements:  The system should be able to maintain the personal information of dealer which includes :  Dealer name, firm name, address, city, state, contact no, e-mail ID (if any), category, and tin no  The system should be able to store the details of purchase which includes:  Dealer‘s firm name, product name, product type, quantity, price, payment mode, payment details.  The system should also be able to store the details of sales done by organization. The details include:  Customer name, date, product name, qty, price.  The system should also be able to maintain the stock of the organization by manipulating purchase and sales details. Owner should be able to assign unique no to the product and sales price. Owner must also be facilitate to store the transportation details which includes:  Receipt no, Dealer firm, transportation name, date, no of parcels, transportation cost.  The entrepreneur must also be facilitate to make the post payment to the dealers and should be able to maintain details of it like dealer name, amt paid, date of payment, mode of payment, payment details.    Owner must be able to store personal details of customers. Which include:  Name, address, city, state, contact no, email ID (if any), tin no (if he is wholesale customer).  And last but never the least, the owner must be able to edit and delete the existing details. This includes:  Transportation  details. Personal details of dealers as well as customers. Purchase information (If any, due to wrong entry of data.) Sales information (If any, due to wrong entry of data.) Details of product (unique on and sale price).

228,http://1000projects.org/customer-support-services-project-in-asp-net.html,customer support services project in asp net.," The entire Customer Support Services Project  ( in Asp.Net ) has been starting from installation of the product. When a product is installed in client side CSE assigns the installation ID to Customer and with this customer can interact with organization in future to rectify their problems. After the process of installation, this application is designed in such a way to generate a report over this installation containing the information of its start date, end date and by whom it has been installed. Not only in this particular section of this process, whenever the requirement arises, can an efficient and relevant report be generated. This system is implemented in such manner.  When Customer makes a complaint against given product, the Administrator assigns the operation of resolving the complaint to any employee in the CSE department available on organization or to CSE who is nearer to customer location. If for a specific service call, a spare is required then the CSE will go to stores, and fill the spare request form. This form is designed with the details of installation ID, product details, and spare parts of the product. If the items need to be charged, then the reports are passed on the account which will generate invoice and collect the amount. Although the CSE may handover the invoice and collect the amount, the money part of the transaction is not within the purview of this system. Relevant to the above mentioned process of the system, this application is implemented with all the necessary entities. Upon requirement, this application has been divided into three modules, such as.            Customer Support Services Project Modules overview:  Administrator module.   Customer module.

230,http://1000projects.org/resource-allocation-to-support-multimedia-services-across-ofdm-systems.html,resource allocation to support multimedia services across ofdm systems.,"  Abstract A resource allocation algorithm was designed to downlink the best effort services and the real-time-OFDMA systems on a wireless channel that varies accordingly with the time. The maximization of the throughput of a system and maintaining the RT and BE service requirements of the QoS is the major property that can be seen in the algorithm proposed. The AADTR (average absolute deviation of transmission rate) of the RT services tolerability that is used to control the fluctuations that rise in it and for the limitation to be provided to the RT packet delay. The resources allocated representing the optimization problem is formulated and solved by using the dual optimization technique that projects the sub-gradient stochastic method. The simulation results have shown that the proposed algorithm satisfies the requirements of QoS maintaining the throughput at high level. The M-LWDF (modified largest weighted delay first) algorithm also supports the requirements.Due to the heavy demand of wireless and mobile computing usage, providing the required bandwidth to all the customers by the respective service providers has become a tedious job.           To meet the demand of networking attributes like bandwidth, rate and resource allocation, every day a new approach is being proposed and most of them deal with the perfect resourced allocation strategies. There are many existing techniques to handle the problem of resource allocation and each technique has its own advantages and disadvantages as discussed in Literature. Allocating the resources by meeting the QoS standards is really a tedious job to handle and in this project I would like to evaluate the functionality of OFDM resource allocation to support the multimedia services as proposed by Kae Won Choi, Wha Sook Jeon at their IEEE transaction Resource Allocation in OFDMA Wireless Communications Systems Supporting Multimedia Services. I will implement the basic algorithm discussed in this transaction and try to evaluate the resource allocation performance based on few metrics like packet delivery rate and bandwidth allocation. Load matrix concept is implemented at the coding level with respect to the algorithm discussed in and develops a dotnet based application to simulate the desired results. File transmission is done by considering two modes of communication like Best Effort (BE) and Real time (RT) that can be used transfer large files regarding multimedia services. Destination displayer screen shows by selecting file receiving path Project background   Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing is the common approaches used these days to transmit the data across mobile communication. It works on the principle of Frequency division multiplexing (FDD), where the complete frequency available to transmit the data is divided in to number of different channels that work across a single broadband medium. Entire data is broken in to number of data streams and passed across a common broadband medium. In general the medium used to transmit the data can be of different types like cables, radio spectrum and optical fibers and the best example of the OFDM based data transmission can be a Cable networks used across TV, where different channels with different frequencies can be viewed using a single optical fiber cable. When ever a source wants to transmit the data, entire data is divided in to different digital data streams and are modulated across sub carriers. Spectral or Bandwidth efficiency of the data transmission can be increased a lot using the OFDM systems. OFDMA systems can promise high data transfer services mixed with the QoS standards. There are many existing techniques that really deal with the frequency division multiplexing and most of them fail in terms of providing best Quality of Services to the meet the customer demands with respect to perfect resource allocation and bandwidth management techniques. OFDMA can be considered as the best choice to support multimedia services while meeting the perfect packet delivery and error rates along with the optimized resource allocation strategies. Apart from the best services provided by this techniques, there exists a problem in supporting the multimedia services and is as discussed in Problem definition section. Problem definition To support the high speed data transfer techniques, a perfect scheduling and resource allocation is always required to meet the requirements from the users. In general the resource allocation is done in terms of user current used channel conditions and Quality of Service requirements. There are many existing scheduling and resource allocation techniques in literature but most of them concentrate on overall system capacity and utility in terms of performance. A unique utility function is defined with respect to the available throughput of the users and in most of the cases this approach is suited for time division multiplexing rather than the required frequency division standards. As per the increase in demand for multimedia services across the OFDM systems, a proper resource allocation scheme is required to handle these requests for resources. Multicast services should be provided to support these multimedia services and the bandwidth should be perfectly utilized to meet the resource requirements across the OFDM systems. In general a multicast OFDM system suffers with the variations of propagation channels across the base station and the mobile users and the data rate is affected with this loss channel gain across the OFDM systems. Overall system performance is affected a lot due to the receiver channel conditions and there are many existing techniques like radio resource allocation can be used to improve the overall system throughput. Sub carrier allocation and data rate allocation across the OFDM systems can also solve this problem, but these methods fail at multi resolution multicast service providing and solve this I will implement a multi resolution multicast radio.

So the problem was in the scheduling of production of specific models and not as much on capacity. It is a sophisticated system that can chalk out the production plan based on sales forecasting.   Need for the system           Some companies manufacture particular amount of product for every month if the manufactured product is not sold out there is a lot of wastage for that month. If the requirement of the product for that particular month is more they cannot manufacture at what amount it is required. Companies manufacturing uniform quantities of all models, some of which were sold out and others, which had excess inventory at the end of every month. So the problem was in the scheduling of production of specific models and not as much on capacity. It is a sophisticated system that can chalk out the production plan based on the forecasting carried out by the national Sales Team.. The sales forecasts are submitted for every month by the sales officers of that particular company.  It involves the transactions of viewing the orders information generated by the sales team, issuing the alerts against the non submission of orders information. If the administrator has to conduct the business by employing a flexible relation between the Sales and Production teams in association with other organization parts, he should have ready lines of information about, the suppliers who practically exist for the supply of raw material, Sales team who conduct the process of organizing the sales and Production team who organizes the production process and finally the inventory team which maintains the details of the all the products associated models details in supporting the sales team in increasing the sales. If it is doing through manual it is the costly process and it takes more time to perform it. If it is handled through web based the process is cheap and it takes less time.            "

Detailed explanation of project is given below.  Existing System           Problem of great theoretical and practical interest is to know what is the worst collusion attack, subject to a maximum  distortion constraint on the illegal copy. This question has been addressed in capacity and error-exponent analysis for fingerprints defined over finite alphabets. Depending on the problem setup, the worst collusion channel is either a memoryless or a “nearly memoryless” multiple-access channel that can be identified as the solution to a communication game. For fingerprints and signals defined over Euclidean spaces, the worst collusion channel subject to mean-squared distortion constraints was identified in the capacity analysis. PROJECT DESCRIPTION  This project has four main modules namely   Registration module Finger print embedding module Collision attack module Authentication module Verification module   Module Description   Registration module   In this module user have enter his personal details . In this module it will collect the user login details. The details will used for his future authentication process Our fingerprints form a randomized orthogonal code, where the randomization parameter is a rotation. The noiseless forgery is obtained by uniform linear averaging of the colluders’ copies. The detector has access to the host signal and performs a binary hypothesis test to verify whether a user of interest is colluding. The cost function in this problem is the detector’s error probability.   Finger print embedding module   In this module the user will act according to the attackers actions. In this projects the user during registration time he will used to embedded his fingerprint information according to his value and store it into the databse specific field. But the original fingerprint will be stored at the back of dupilicate fingerprint with embedding . so this makes the the user data to be in safer side.            "

Usually two ECG measurement systems are used in the tests and a two ECG corbel along with a 12 channel ECG device issued. Both the products as well as the devices belong from the Corscience company. Because of the processing problem a 12 channel ECG from the device through the Bluetooth to the mobile stations, the packet parsing problem was discussed and it leads to two solutions.  Another portion of the processing of the biomedical data is visualized. Another presentation of the window presentation foundation solution was made and tested. Monitoring systems that are embedded on the mobile device are based on the wide mobile operating system that is designed by the Microsoft company.  On the basis of the. Net framework the entire system is designed and at the  same time it is also based on the .NET Micro Framework, .NET Compact Framework and Microsoft SQL Server. In the real environment in the room if cryogenic that is at the -136 degree centigrade the project is tested successfully.           In the extreme conditions the devices that are used for measuring are tested and it includes rigorous testings in a crogen room in a spa Czech republic. The platforms that were developed passed through In sense testings with high credibility of data that is measured for the physicians.  Further these experimental data will be used by the physicians to make recommendations for the heart patients who are kept in the cryogenic chamber for healing purposes.

At the same time typically several requests arrived which lead to a competition for the available resources. Such situations querying is based on models and it is recognized widely.  Novel models, algorithms have been proposed to limit the queue model of the factor of performance. Plus, it is also shown that the algorithms and proposed models can be used to predict the performance of a web based system software in the environment of ASP.NET. Our work aims to validate the models that is proposed as well as the algorithm to verify the accuracy of the prediction of the performance with the measurement of performance in the ASP.NET surroundings. The results showcased that the metrics performance and algorithms are much more correct and accurate that the algorithm and the original model. The web based software application system is an important and complex consideration as it has a large number of users who provide high service availability with low time of response. At the same time a certain level of throughput is guaranteed. A properly designed model for performance and appropriate algorithm evaluation can help in the prediction of the metrics performance in the early development process.            Several methods have been proposed in the last few years  for this issue. Most of them is based on the queuing networks of the extended versions or directly on the queueing network. Petri-nets and stochastic Petri-nets are used by another group. Stochastic extension of the algebraic process is the third kind of approach like EMPA, TIPP and PEPA. There are many factors that can influence the performance of the metrics. Various configurable parameters have been investigated by various  papers. And they affect the web based software system performance. For retrieving the factors that influence the performance are used in the hypothesis tests and statistical methods.            "

Further in certain in cases it can also be used for launching an attack. Stenography is the only solution to it. This is a most common technique of hiding information in the form of digital images. In comparison to the cryptography technique this method not only make it known to others that information is retained in the hidden form but also restrict other from even making out that any such information exists. As more and more people are going the cyberspace revolution this technique of steganography is also gaining a lot of importance. This is the way of hiding information in such a manner that it does not enable the intruder to detect the secret message. An array of communication methods that are need to be kept secretively makes up the steganography. This is the system that enables to hide the secret message and also protect it from being discovered.  Information is now kept electronically with the advancement in ICT. Information security is the most important issue nowadays. For securing the information’s apart from using the cryptographic method nowadays steganography is also being used. In the cryptography technique usually the message that is encrypted is embed before passing on with the help of the network connection, in a digital host. This keeps the presence of the message unknown. Not only this system helps in hiding the dats but it has also extended in the protection of copywriting of video, images and audio for media.

This system do not able others detect the messages that are hidden in various ways. The word steganography is derived from a Greek work which means “covered writing”.  It consist of a long chain of secret methods of communications that completely conceal the existence of the messages. Invisible ink, character arrangement, microdots, signatures in digital format, converting of channels and communications through spread spectrum are some of the methods that are used in this technique. Both the techniques cryptography and steganography are twin cousins and they act in the spy craft family. A message in the cipher text format can easily arouse suspicion in the mind of the recipient while on the other hand, the use of invisible messages created with the art of stenography will not do any such things.            In comparison to the cryptography technique where the intruder is allowed to modify as well as intercept the messages without even violating the premises of the security that is guaranteed by cryptosystem the steganography is used to conceal messages in other messages in such a format that it never allows the hacker to detect that there is even any existence of a second secretive message. The digital fingerprinting and watermarking for video and audio is hugely in demand in the present industry and it enhances the steganography technique highly. With the discovery of high speed computers steganography in the form of images has reached the edge. the Least Significant Bit  Insertion is one of the most popular technique that is used in image steganography.

Ideal Grid is still a theoretical concept which envisions leveraging the entire computational resource of the world into one vast network.  The Infinity Grid Computational framework, limits the design to a specific domain of the network and the types of resources that will be used for sharing and selection, while maintaining the integrity of an abstract Grid.            Framework is based on Middle ware Architecture which provides functionality. Middle ware is the component which runs on throughout the grid and it is this component with which the grid directly interacts.  The architecture is completely peer-to-peer with each system in the grid capable of submitting the job to the Middle ware independently.  Dot net is used for implementation of the framework designed due to its effective server application and better network application.   The implementation language provides a large set of functionality and create a more sophisticated and effective work. This software is also platform independent.  Need and Scope of this project The purpose of the project Infinity is to design and develop a Grid Communicator Framework, exploiting under-utilized computing resources over a network.  Grid will provide remote execution of jobs that require very high computational power in terms of CPU and memory space. Software will search for the best available system in the grid by collecting system status data at that instance of time and determine the most feasible system that can used to execute the job. The details of the design and implementation of the framework is described later in the report.  The basic features employed in the Grid Computational Framework are as follows:-  Remote execution of the jobs requiring high CPU and memory capacity in a connected network of LAN. Harnessing massive power of underutilized resources scattered all over the network (LAN). Registering of the services so that once a job has been submitted and executed remotely on the grid, user would have to just pass the argument when next time he wishes to execute the same program.  Provide a graphical interface for running the job in the grid.

The choice of music differs from one people to another and thus obviously you will get to see only his favorite types of music on his computer’s storage device.  Sharing and transferring of music is also very common.            You will need to hide the message in such in such a way in the image file so that no great changes take place after the message insertion in the image file.  On the other hand, if the message is encrypted then the security level will automatically increase. Now even if you want to discover the hidden message then you will get to see only the encrypted message that you cannot decrypt in any way.  There is a goal behind every project and similarly here the main object is to embed the information using stenography into a well known media.  In comparison to the media file this text will be much shorter. For e.g.: a relation between the lyrics and a recoded song. Usually the song lyrics in ASCII files are smaller in comparison to the image file recordings. So you can safely embed steganographically the smaller file without hampering the quality into the larger file. Video data and close capturing information are also another topic of argument. This project focuses on the lyrics to create a karaoke machine, driven steganographically.  Here the lyrics will embed and displayed when the file will run on the screen. Implementation of steganographic algorithm is necessary for encoding data into image files.  It extracts the data and plays it separately. This is an ideal research for extracting song and lyrics.

In this paper we will see how the application maintains the administration and the inventory system details. By giving the request for the sales or the production details it checks from the administrator database and processes the request. In this the application runs the ERP sales between the supplier, administrator and the consumer. In this paper we will be looking into production purchase and billing system, supplier registration and validation system, customer edit details and supplier edit details. Brief on the data flow models: An administrative system is present which maintains the details of the raw materials supplied from the supplier and also maintains the details of the goods supplied to the customers. Here the inventory system maintains the details of the checks issued to the supplier and the payments received from the customer and also maintains a production account for maintaining the details of the finished goods.            The production system also checks the availability of the goods for generation of the bills and it maintains a finance database for maintain the billing processes. A billing system is present where the user can look into his account by entering his user id and password and can check the bills by sending a request to the administrator. Conclusions: It is very difficult for the persons to look after huge databases and generate responses for the requests.

It is simple that contain 80 keywords but it is highly expensive and to implement modern programming concept.           SQL server:-SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is use to design database of any software. It includes insert, update, delete and modification query. It is sub divided into several languages for example clauses, which are used in statements. Expressions are to produce tables containing rows and columns. Queries which retrieve data from the table. In SQL semicolon is for termination the statement. Case tool: – Case tool is used to define system behavior that what happens inside and outside the system. It described the flow of event and its action. We use sequence diagram to show the behavior of system. In it collaboration is done in which a team is formed of few members to solve the system errors. In this we use the class to show the system structure, their attributes and their relationship with each other. In class the upper part holds the class name, middle part has the attributes and bottom part has the operation to be undertaken. Requirement: – It requires a windows xp operating system.

The suggested algorithm’s chief objective is increasing system throughput while gratifying quality of service(QoS) needs of the RT and BE services.  Two types of QoS services are considered. First includes the necessary average transfer rate for RT and BE services. Second includes the bearable average absolute deviation of transmission rate (AADTR) which is only for RT services and is employed to curb the variation in transfer rates and to restrict the RT packet defer to a temperate degree. We define the maximization problem portraying the resource allocation being regarded, and resolve it by employing the dual optimization technique and the projection stochastic sub gradient method. Assumption outcome displays that the supposed algorithm satisfies the QoS needs with great throughput and surpasses the modified largest weighted delay first (M-LWDF) algorithm that upholds same QoS needs.  Though this approach refines the system throughput, it can lead to the deprivation of the user who is facing a difficulty from a faulty route since long, that leads to extensive packet defer. As far as the RT users are concerned, the extensive defer heads to extreme deterioration of performance. The suggested algorithm conquers this hurdle by the limited use of route deviation, where the limitation is provided by the QoS needs of RT and BE traffic.            Hardware Requirements:  The system should have a Pentium- IV 2.4 GHz processor, a Hard Disk of 40GB, A Floppy Drive of 1.44MB, a 15 VGA colour Monitor, a Logitech mouse and a RAM of 256 MB.  Software Requirements:  The system should have an Operating Software-Windows XP Professional, a Front end-Visual Studio 2005, a Coding Language-Visual C# .Net and a Back-End-Sql Server 2000.

The terminal occupies a strategic partnership with major shipping lines to provide customers in the country and the regions with links to more than 100 ports around the world. CTMS has two major modules they are 1. Containers module.           2. In-Yard operations module. Containers module: The containers modules handles the following areas they are Export Containers: The voyage call has been registered container port through system with reference by shipping agent. The shipping agent will assign the hauler to handle the container to port. The customs clearance will be handled forwarding agent appointed by shipping agent. After clearance the container enters into hauler and is then accepted by port terminal and is stacked in yard location. On arrival of vessel the container will be loaded in the vessel and necessary bill will be generated by the system. Import Containers: The voyage call has been registered by the container terminal through the system with reference to shipping agent. On the arrival of vessel containers are discharged from vessel and stack is allocated in yard location. Empty containers: Empty containers are same as import and export containers Reefer container handling: Refrigerators are stored in the yard as it requires necessary cooling before loading the ship or delivery to the customer. In-yard operation module: The following activities take place in this module they are  Packing or unpacking In-yard movement Yard planning  Packing or unpacking: The forwarding agent may request the port terminal to pack their cargo into the container empty container which is stacked in the yard. The port terminal will pack all the cargo into specified container and convert this into export. In-yard movement: All the containers inside the yard are handled by private carriers. The necessary data to move the container by the carrier are communicated through wireless system called RDT. The CTMS application will communicate with RDT system to receive and send data based the VMT/HMT requests. Yard planning: The location for stack import or export containers is planned prior to container arrival. In turn the yard planning is controlled by CTMS.  Download Container Terminal Management System CTMS Project Report.

It is generally done in online shopping.           In physical card based purchase the fraudulent transactions can be done only if the attacker was able to steal the card from cardholder and if the cardholder doesn’t notice the loss of credit card it may lead to financial loss. At present the fraud is detected after the fraud is done that when the card holder complaints. The online purchases are more so we don’t know how the person is using the card online we just capture IP address for verification. So there an urgent need to investigate about the fraud. Fraud detection based on analysis of existing purchase data of cardholder is a promising way to reduce the rate of successful credit card frauds. As humans tend to exhibit various behavioral profiles, each cardholder can be represented by a set of patterns containing information about typical purchase category, the time since last purchase, amount paid etc. This process is known as HMM Hidden Markov Model. The details of items purchased are not known at FDS running at the bank that issues credit cards to cardholders. The modules present in this project are as follows  New card: The customer provides their contact and personal information to obtain a credit card. They can create their own login and password. Login:  With the valid usernames and passwords the users can visit the website Security information: When the user looses the card security information module arises. In order to move to the transaction section he has to answer a set of questions. Transaction: The credit card owner or authorized person can only make the transactions Verification: In this process the card number is verified to ensure that the  transaction is made by card holder itself.   Download Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Hidden Markov Model Project Report.

This will helps user to maintain the security of his data or videos. The proposed system helps to check whether one video is same as the other video. The method being used to verify the similarity of the video is it checks the similarity of the frames being shot of both the videos and if they are found to be similar it tells us that the videos are similar. The project approach is mainly on finding the duplicate videos by calculating the distance between the frames have been shot but it will also consider the fact of the order of the frame and the alignment of the frames. Edit distance is the another factor that has been considered to check the similarity between the two videos. Edit distance tell us how many number of times the video has been edited and so that you can decide then similarity of video. The number of algorithm is being used to find the similarity of the videos but we will be using the query algorithm to check equate the video similarity.  This methods follows some steps which are as follows. a.)    Extraction.           b.)    Mapping. c.)    Refine search. a.)    EXTRACTION: In this first  step of the algorithm it extracts the sample video and the main video in frames as per the respective frame size  and then stores them in the location selected by the user. b.)    MAPPING: Mapping is the second step of the algorithm after the video images are extracted algorithm needs to compare the stored frame to equate the similarity. So in this step the first image of the sample video and the main video is being equated and check whether they are equal or not. c.)    REFINE SEARCH: Refine search is the third step of the algorithm. After the Extraction and Mapping the images from the previous step are filtered and then again compared for the similarity between them.

In this case, multi path routing will be helpful which will distribute traffic among different paths.           In this paper we cover new efficient methods in multipath networking which utilizes different paths between source and sink, this method is used because of low traffic overhead.  This protocol works with low energy and provides efficient and reliable transmission. Other factors in this system include using available energy more efficiently and finding out multiple routes more efficiently based on the received nodes information. Performance of these new algorithms is checked using simulators and the result shows this new method is more efficient compare to existing methods. download Energy efficient multipath routing algorithm for wireless sensors reference document.              "

With this structure, web pages are linked to each other when relate contextual. There could be several links to a single page, or every document usually has at least two ways to get it. Links could lead the users in a circular path. From  the navigation point of view, this kind of site  is very appealing. It allows the users to get around this site quickly and enjoy a more free form experience of the site. Hence most of the designers use the spider web like approach to organize their content and the web sites.  Dynamic  Web Server Architecture:                      Web sites require a specialized database they must perform well in a distributed architecture, support object oriented applications and store extended data types like images, spatial and multimedia. Web sites use an object-oriented data base management system (ODBMS) because they are optimized for distributed, object-oriented that store new data types.                                The flow of messages and data in this web server architecture takes place in the following manner. The web browser sends a request for an html template to the web server via the http protocol. The web server receives the request and passes it to one of a pool of ODBMS web service processes on the same machine or LAN as the web server. The web server and the web service communicate via a protocol, which could be either a CGI, FCGI , ISAPI or NSAPI. The web service combines the html in the template file with variables return from the methods to form html dynamically. The browsers thus receive the relation systems by a synchronization gateway.

1059,http://1000projects.org/cell-breathing-techniques-for-load-balancing-in-wireless-lans.html,cell breathing techniques for load balancing in wireless lans.,"  In future we can introduce this Cell Breathing Techniques for Load Balancing in Wireless LANs in internet connection mainly in WIFI technology. Already in this project we proved that by using this method we can avoid the network traffic or overload on APs. If we apply this technology on WIFI connection means, we can increase the speed of the internet and get connection continuously without any interrupt. Definitely in future cell breathing method would occupy the major part of the communication field.                           We are going to develop a novel scheme for optimal load balancing in IEEE 802.11 WLANs. We provided rigorous analysis of the problem and presented two algorithms that find Deterministic optimal solutions. The first algorithm minimizes the load of the congested AP(s) in the network, and the second algorithm produces an optimal min-max (Priority) load balanced solution. These optimal solutions are obtained only with the minimal information which is readily available without any special assistance from the 748 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING, VOL. 8, NO. 6, JUNE 2009.In this Project, we can assume only the control on the transmission power of the AP beacon messages. The simulations show that even a small number of power levels, e.g., between 5 and 10, is enough to achieve near optimal results. Application:            In mobile networks nowadays using cell breathing technology for roaming purpose to avoid overload in home network Cell breathing method which finds deterministic global optimal solutions for providing fairness to get the digital voice clarity.

1060,http://1000projects.org/final-project-report-on-power-billing-system.html,final project report on power billing system.," Final Project Report on Power Billing System Modules Description: Login This module is considered only when there is a requirement of safety and security by the customer. Only after the login process, the rest of the application is made available to the user.            In order to log in, the user has to first register by providing desired user-ID and password. Provided user-IDs and passwords by the users are maintained in a database. Oracle database is used to maintain a database. Then the user logins into the application by giving user-ID and password provided during registration process. JDBC is used to connect the application with the database.  User Login Sequence will be as follows:  User registration by providing user-ID and password(credentials)  The user will be prompted to enter user credentials.  If the user enters correct credentials then he gets access to the application.   Consumer Management To design front-end forms according to consumer specifications it was like Addition of new consumer, deletion, modification of consumer, processing bills, journals, debit respectively. This module deals with consumer information details.  New Consumer Acquisition The proposed software allows the end user to add the new consumer with his personal service (meter and Deposit) details. It generates a unique consumer Identification number based on the DISCOM, Circle, and division, Subdivision, Section and Distribution to which he belongs.  Modification of Consumer If any particulars have modified with consumer details, this sub-module is used to modify the consumer details.  Deletion of consumer If any consumer disconnects the connection then we have to delete the consumer related information from the system. This module is used to delete the consumer. Deletion is made is based on some rules like the payment details will be nil.  Message is displayed as do you want to delete the record.  This deleting record is first entered into watch table. Then this record is deleted from Cons table, Bill, Meter part, deposit tab, calculator and PMTTAT tables.  Query Consumer When ever we need to see the details of any particular consumer then this sub module will invoke the details and will display on the screen. Meter Change Every consumer is having meter for reading details. If meter will change then the meter details will be change in database. This sub module is used to update meter details. Meter part Change If any changes occurred in meter particulars then this sub module is used to update. The difference between Meter Change and Meter part Change is when ever Meter will change Meter Change sub module will use and Meter will not Change but Meter Characteristics will change then Meter part sub module will use. Online Receipt This sub module is user to online bill payment receipts. It will provide the entry fields to accept payments. It will show the consumer bill details and based on that we will know the bill details which were belongs to consumer whether consumer is having arrears or not. It is done on the spot when the consumer comes to pay bill. This is used by the persons, who know the RC (Revenue Collection) password. Offline Receipt This sub module is user to offline bill payment receipts. It is also same as online receipts, but it is used when consumers will pay the bill at general counters. It will show the consumer bill details and based on that we will know the bill details which were belongs to consumer whether consumer is having arrears or not. It is done after the consumer paid the bills offline. This is used by the persons, who know the RC (Revenue Collection) password. Receipt Cancel This sub module is allows the user to correct the mistakes done in using online receipt and offline receipt. It will provide the entry fields to cancel the payment receipts only. It will show the receipt details, which was done still by particular RC Counter. This is used by the persons, who know the RC (Revenue Collection) password. Billing & Accounting Journal Entry Journal entry done when a consumer had any debit, credit amounts to pay .To that bill if any additional charges, electricity duty, interest on electricity duty levied on particular consumer no. In this lccode should present in journal. If we enter consumer no corresponding name should be displayed and rest of the fields we should enter. It should be updated to Journal.  Cancellation of Journal If we want to cancel that particular person cancels any journal. It should check LC code, voucher number should match LC code, voucher date should match LC code, voucher no and then date field is selected. Then fields we are selected into corresponding text boxes. This journal is cancelled with field Jtcancelid+=y. Now the field is cancelled from journal.  Change RC Password Every ERO is having RC Counters to receive online payments. Each RC Counter is hiving RC Code and RC Password. This sub module is allows the user to change his Password for security purpose. Security requirementsUsers are provided with a login page which contains a user-ID field and a password field. Users are requested to register before using the application. Then, the registered user is asked to provide the password and log-in user-ID in order to access the tool. This ensures security by allowing only authorized users.            "

The different attacks mentioned here will be explained further in the following chapters. The Problem: However, the rise in popularity of online banking has not only attracted the consumers but also the fraudsters. Online Banking Management System fraud is usually possible when a criminal gains personal information of users by tricking them to enter their details in a website or an e-mail [BBC, 2010]. Fraudulent bank activity in online banking increased significantly every year while being reduced in case of credit/debit cards.           According to UK Cards Association, card fraud has totaled £440m in 2009 which is 28% less compared to the previous year[Bbc, 2010] .At the same time the number of “phishing” attacks rose by 16%.  The fall in card fraud in UK is mainly with the introduction of “Chip and Pin” technology [Frowen, 2010]. This indicates, in the same way some new security measures must be introduced in online banking to prevent fraudulent activity. (from interim) The losses incurred due to fraud  in Online Banking Management System is alarming and the introduction of new security measures is required to prevent this. The fraudsters use different ways to attack the user’s pc, systems, networks, servers, websites to obtain the required data for fraudulent activities. The different attacks and threats possible on the e- banking are explained thoroughly in the next chapters. Download Online Banking Management System .Net Final Year Project            "

The computers identified by it unique address and communicate through the wide range of networks. So sending and receiving the message in a particular wide network is bit difficult. To interact, a host with another host or destination, the host must know the identity and the shortest path to reach the message for the particular host. This is the reason to approach a new system for scalable and efficient end-to-end communication network mechanism. Scope of the System: The proposed system has been implemented by a lot of algorithms to give the sufficient and efficient performance topology for a lager scale network. Strengthen of this system is not even the sink node, every one in the networks have a overlay tree and maintain a partially discovered topology.            Objectives and Success Criteria of the Project:  To reduce, measurement redundancy, our scheme integrates the doubletree algorithm. To reduce trace route size, set up a lookup table for routers. To reduce the computational overhead, the proposed system conducting topology abstraction and reducing the computational frequency.

1095,http://1000projects.org/vehicle-traffic-management-control-system-vb-cse-final-year-project-with-code.html,vehicle traffic management control system vb cse final year project with code.," The Vehicle Traffic Management & Control System VB CSE Final Year Project has three basic components, which are  Image Grabbing from the camera Processing the images Store and alert mechanisms  1. Image grabbing from the camera: This particular module involves:            A Digital Camera A driver for camera Java Media Framework  The module continuously monitors and grabs the images of a lane and stores them in 8-bit JPEG format. The camera is a Charge Coupled Device Camera (CCDC). The CCDC is a digital camera whose output is a video stream. As the output is digital the stream data can directly be fed into the computer.         For this module to work the camera driver need to be installed before. The Java Media Framework needs the driver to be installed as the JMF using query mechanism with driver. The JMF creates an object of type player, which is used for grabbing images. After grabbing images, the raw image is stored in buffer. The raw data is converted into image and then converted into 8-bit image. The 8-bit image is encoded into the JPEG format and is stored into the disk. Processing the images:         The purpose of this component is to compare the images acquired and say whether, there is significant change. If the change crosses the threshold that has been defined based on the observations made on lane that the camera should monitor then the algorithm generates an alert. This particular component involves the following operations on the image  Image Sensing and Acquisition Image Sampling and Quantization Grey level and color enhancement Convolution and Correlation Image Enhancing in Spatial Domain Neighborhood and Geometric operations Segmentation   This particular module takes the images stored in the database and samples such that the image is suitable for the operations that can be performed on the image.  After it has been made compatible to the format of the algorithms the image is enhanced using the Grey level operations on the image since there is every possibility that noise can get introduced into the image captured by the camera due various reasons such as thunder bolt, software or hardware problems, by faults in the image setup etc since the image captured should be utilized to the maximum and for the sake of the clarity in the picture we cannot sacrifice the precious time in our hands.  Convolution helps enhancing the image in the same domain. Once the image meets the standards desired. Correlation algorithms can be applied on the images to see whether there sufficient change in the images captured.               Here Segmentation comes to our aid in segmenting the images into various regions. The regions are the components that are actually taken into the consideration while comparing the images. Since the whole image, if taken for the comparison then even a small change in the light component any where in the image, then the algorithm used says that there is significant change in the image even though in practice there is no significant change in the images captured according to our requirements. Store and Alert Mechanisms:      This module is responsible for two tasks:  Store the information into data base If there is a traffic jam then sending info to the control room(not implemented)   The Data Base Management that we are using in Oracle. In the database the image information is stored. The information include  Timestamp of the image File name Drive where images are stored                     Using the JDBC the images are retrieved by embedding the SQL statements. The driver that is using is ODBC. Using file name and driver name the images are retrieved. The images are deferred using timestamp that is associated with each image.                  If there is a traffic jam the second module generates the alert message. The alert message is sent to the control room using TCP/IP networking model. The Java Networking component sends the “Traffic Jam Detected” message to the control room and also sends the URL of the image to the control room. In control room the traffic status can be viewed by using this URL, if necessary Hardware specifications:  The H/W requirements for the system are:  PIII Processor with 256MB RAM 10 GB HDD USB camera to take a pictures with coverage of 100mts LAN card Server with WINDOWS NT 4.0 WORKSTATION Client for Image Processing   Software specifications:  The S/W requirements for the system are:  Windows 2000 Java2SDK 1.4 Java Media Framework (JMF) 1.4 ORACLE 8i for database engineering Camera drivers    Download Vehicle Traffic Management & Control System VB CSE Final Year Project With Code            "

This work demonstrates that it is possible to predict one such Market to a high degree of accuracy. Neural network predictions were obtained for the daily Market close 5 days ahead, and 25 days ahead, as measured in mean square error and in root mean square error.            To measure percentage accuracy, each individual test case prediction was compared with the actual market outcome, and total percentage accuracy for the whole test set was similarly calculated. Comparisons were also drawn with predictions for the same test cases using four types of Multiple Linear Regression.  The neural network results indicated that predictions based upon the lowest mean square error bear little relationship to the same test cases, when measured in terms of overall percentage accuracy.      Existing System:              Maintaining the data of Stock Market manually is very difficult where we deal with huge amount of data and the data will be changing frequently depending upon the share market. Viewing of the required data is also a big problem and end-user will not get the clear idea about the flow of the system.

The application for the storage of the data has been planned. Using the constructs of MS-SQLServer2000 and all the user interfaces has been designed using the ASP.Net technologies. The database connectivity is planned using the “SQL Connection” methodology. The standards of security and data protective mechanism have been given a big choice for proper usage.            The application takes care of different modules and their associated reports, which are produced as per the applicable strategies and standards that are put forwarded by the administrative staff.   I-Connect Development:  The “I-Connect” is an application that has been developed for a well-established regional bank operating primarily in south India.  The bank has several branches in key cities and towns in the north. In the world of this competitive environment and technological development, the bank has been totally computerized in the last 3 years, and to increase its customer base has started planning, for a concept called as e-banking; with this concept, the bank wants to move very nearer to the customers and increase its basic operational strategies.  Through I-Connect the bank wants to introduce the core concept of IT based Enabled Services (ITES). The “I-Connect” services are executed only upon the customer, and these I-Connect services would fully integrate with the core banking solution that is already in usage.  The major idea is to provide a series of services to the customer through the internet and make the customer feel flexible in calling out simple tasks faster instead of making a visit to the bank every time. The “I-Connect” service is open only to savings bank Customers and not for current account holders.  The customer is privileged to use most of the system only as a viewing phase, the only online transactions the customer can do are check book requisition and fund transfer among his personal accounts. This document contains a description for “E-Banking” enhancement.  This document will contain the functional requirements of the project and how the developers will enhance the project to achieve all the objectives. The SRS will serve as a guide for the client and the developers. The entire project has been developed keeping in view of the distributed client server computing technology, in mind. The present system is manual.  Conclusion:  The Project Metrics has to enter all the details of project, documents, and tasks.

One is the administrator login level and the other is the staff login level. The registered user should enter the user name and password and is allowed to login. After clicking the login button, if correct details are entered the user is redirected to home window where there are several links.  If incorrect user name and password are entered, a login failed message box is displayed.  So, the user has to retype the correct user name and password for login. The home window contains menu bar with master, student and staff menus. Master menu provides provisions to add new courses, branches, semesters and subject details and also provide provision to view, update and delete the inserted details.  Student menu provides provisions to insert, delete, update and view the student details. It also provides provisions to insert student marks and automatically calculates the internal marks. Staff menu provides provision to insert, delete in the existing system, the internal marks are calculated after a heavy manual work.  The work of entering marks after each exam, profile updating in each semester is a hard task. In Existing System, there are chances for data loss. All these processes consume more time and require more manual efforts, update and view staff details.  Finally, the result of the computer output is compared with the original manual procedures.  Conclusion:  The disadvantages with the client server architecture led to the development of three-tier architecture. Due to disadvantages of traditional approach, client/server architecture was introduced. In this architecture, data is separated from the client side and is stored at a centralized location that acts as server. The business logic is combined with the presentation logic either at the client side or at the server side that has the database connectivity code. download Project Report  of  CSE Assessment Emulator .Net Project.

1127,http://1000projects.org/a-signature-free-buffer-overflow-attack-blocker-a-java-net-project-report.html,a signature free buffer overflow attack blocker a java net project report.," Description:  A Signature-free Buffer Overflow Attack Blocker a Java .Net Project propose SigFree, a real-time, signature-free, out-of the box, application layer blocker for preventing buffer overflow attacks, one of the most serious cyber security threats. SigFree can filter out code-injection buffer overflow attack messages targeting at various Internet services such as web service.  Motivated by the observation that buffer overflow attacks typically contain executables whereas legitimate client requests never contain executables in most Internet services, SigFree blocks attacks by detecting the presence of code. SigFree first blindly dissembles and extracts instruction sequences from a request.            It then applies a novel technique called code abstraction, which uses data flow anomaly to prune useless instructions in an instruction sequence. Finally it compares the number of useful instructions to a threshold to determine if this instruction sequence contains code. Sigfree Application  SigFree is signature free, thus it can block new and unknown buffer overflow attacks; SigFree is also immunized from most attack-side code obfuscation methods. Since SigFree is transparent to the servers being protected, it is good for economical Internet wide deployment with very low deployment and maintenance cost.  We implemented and tested SigFree; our experimental study showed that SigFree could block all types of code injection attack packets (above 250) tested in our experiments. Moreover, SigFree causes negligible throughput degradation to normal client requests. In existing system Detection of Data Flow Anomalies are in static or dynamic methods, to detect data flow anomalies in the software reliability and testing  field. Conclusion:  Static methods are not suitable in our case due to its slow speed; dynamic methods are not suitable either due to the need for real execution of a program with some inputs. In our proposed project this SigFree, a real-time, signature free, out of- the-box blocker that can filter code-injection buffer overflow attack messages, one of the most serious cyber security threats, to various Internet services.  SigFree does not require any signatures, thus it can block new, unknown attacks. It is immunized from most attack-side code obfuscation methods, good for economical Internet wide deployment with little maintenance cost and negligible throughput degradation and can also handle encrypted SSL messages.

1138,http://1000projects.org/steganography-a-net-project.html,steganography a net project.," Introduction: Steganography a .Net Project is the process of hiding messages in a way that only the intended recipient is aware of that message. The project is titled “Steganography” and explains the technique in detail. The messages are first encrypted by traditional means; the converted text is modified again resulting in stegotext. This technique is used in electronic communication as in MP3 file or protocol. Important files possessing confidential data are stored in server in encrypted form and access is limited only to authorized people only. While in transit too, the message is in encrypted form to prevent access by others. Modern cryptography techniques have several algorithms for encryption and decryption. They are coded on bases of keys which are used in the encryption algorithm.           Working: In this project “Steganography” less important information in the digital data is replaces by hidden data. This process is implemented over the spectrum of the entire range. In the image considered here, a sequence of 24 bits represent a single pixel. Thus 3 bytes of color info give 256 color combinations for each color thus allowing representation of 16.7 million colors. Here around 11 pixels represent a part of a solid-color background. Thus in the sequence generated the least significant bit of each 8-bit byte is replaced to hide a text message by ASCII binary. The hidden message replaces 32 of the 264 bytes constituting 12% and is in four 8-bit bytes. By this technique the hidden message is transmitted. Conclusion: This project is very useful in the field of communication where information transmission is an important component. Thus this method is efficient in transmitting confidential information. Thus, the project designed here is 100% free and is ready for implementation. In the future enhancements such as investigating the feasibility of embedding programs in firewalls to act as a first line of defense against stenographic data transmission.             "
