ABSTRACT: This paper investigates the fault ride through (FRT) capability improvement of a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbine using a dynamic voltage restorer (DVR). Series compensation of terminal voltage during fault conditions using DVR is carried out by injecting voltage at the point of common coupling to the grid voltage to maintain constant DFIG stator voltage. However, the control of the DVR is crucial in order to improve the Fault Ride Through capability in the DFIG-based wind turbines. The combined feed-forward and feedback (CFFFB)-based voltage control of the DVR verifies good transient and steadystate responses. The improvement in performance of the DVR using CFFFB control compared with the conventional feed-forward control is observed in terms of voltage sag mitigation capability, active and reactive power support without tripping, dc-link voltage balancing, and fault current control. The advantage of utilizing this combined control is verified through MATLAB/Simulink-based simulation results using a 1.5-MW grid connected DFIG-based wind turbine. The results showgood transient and steady-state response and good reactive power support during both balanced and unbalanced fault conditions.    KEYWORDS:  Doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) Dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) Fault Ride-Through (FRT) Low Voltage Ride Through (LVRT) Combined feed forward feedback control MPPT    SOFTWARE: MATLAB/SIMULINK   BLOCK DIAGRAM:  Fig. 1.

Series compensation scheme using DVR proves to be very effective with good reactive power compensation scheme, voltage control and power flow control. The performance comparison suggests that the operation of DVR is a good suit for improving FRT capability in DFIG based variable speed wind turbines as per grid code standards. The investigated combined Feed Forward and Feed Back (CFFFB) control has many advantages like simplicity with limited controller complexity. The controller is used to investigate the improvement in performance of Fault Ride Through capability operation in DFIG wind turbine while modifying the voltage control of a DVR. The DVR proves to deliver very good transient voltage control, fault current control and reactive power support. The controller contributes in better harmonic compensation compared to conventional control as per IEEE 519 standards. The simulation results performed using a 1.5 MW DFIG based wind turbine connected to electrical grid show better performance of DVR with the combined Feed-Forward and Feed-Back control for improving the Fault Ride Through capability of DFIG based wind turbines.   REFERENCES:  A.

http://asokatechnologies.in/multiconverter-unified-power-quality-conditioning-system-mc-upqc/,"ABSTRACT: This paper presents a new unified power-quality conditioning system (MC-UPQC), capable of simultaneous compensation for voltage and current in multibus/multifeeder systems. In this configuration, one shunt voltage-source converter (shunt VSC) and two or more series VSCs exist. The system can be applied to adjacent feeders to compensate for supply-voltage and load current imperfections on the main feeder and full compensation of supply voltage imperfections on the other feeders. In the proposed configuration, all converters are connected back to back on the dc side and share a common dc-link capacitor. Therefore, power can be transferred from one feeder to adjacent feeders to compensate for sag/swell and interruption. The performance of the MC-UPQC as well as the adopted control algorithm is illustrated by simulation. The results obtained in PSCAD/EMTDC on a two-bus/two-feeder system show the effectiveness of the proposed configuration.

The new configuration is named multi converter unified power-quality conditioner (MC-UPQC). Compared to a conventional UPQC, the proposed topology is capable of fully protecting critical and sensitive loads against distortions, sags/swell, and interruption in two-feeder systems. The idea can be theoretically extended to multibus/multifeeder systems by adding more series VSCs. The performance of the MC-UPQC is evaluated under various disturbance conditions and it is shown that the proposed MC-UPQC offers the following advantages: 1)  power transfer between two adjacent feeders for sag/swell and interruption compensation; 2) compensation for interruptions without the need for a battery storage system and, consequently, without storage capacity limitation; 3) sharing power compensation capabilities between two adjacent feeders which are not connected.

http://asokatechnologies.in/self-tuned-fuzzy-proportional/,"Self-tuned fuzzy-proportional–integral compensated zero/minimum active power algorithm based dynamic voltage restorer ABSTRACT: Voltage sag is the most common and severe power quality problem in the recent times due to its detrimental effects on modern sensitive equipment. Generally, direct-on-line starting of the three-phase induction motor (IM) and various kinds of short circuit fault are directly responsible for this event. This study investigates the impacts of starting and stopping of two three phase IMs on the load voltage profile. To be more critical, two three-phase short circuit faults and one unsymmetrical fault are also simulated in the same network at different instants of time. A simple control algorithm of a real power optimised dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) with a reduced power factor strategy is presented to protect the sensitive load from these types of detrimental events. A novel fuzzy-proportional–integral based self-tuned control methodology is implemented in the proposed work to compensate the loss in the DVR circuit as well as to regulate the load voltage and the direct current link voltage. The results show the effectiveness of the adopted control scheme in DVR application to mitigate the voltage sag.  KEYWORDS:  Dynamic Voltage Restorer fuzzy-proportional-integral  SOFTWARE: MATLAB/SIMULINK   DIAGRAM:   Fig. 1 Investigated distributed test system with DVR    EXPECTED SIMULATION RESULTS:  Figure 2.

Minimisation of energy delivered may increase the life of the ESU, therefore limits the expenditure indirectly. The self-tuned fuzzy-Proportional-Integral scheme also plays a significant role to regulate the active power through the DVR as well as to compensate the load voltage and DVR losses. The results obtained in this work shows that the proposed DVR solution provides a good and satisfactory level of compensation. The system voltage has been compensated nearly up to its nominal value. The DC voltage is also very fairly regulated. The application of DVR reduces the level of oscillation in the torque profile of the IM. The proposed method is also compared with other strategies surfaced in the existing literature and it is unfold that the proposed strategy offers better harmonic compensation and it also provides better damping in the load voltage. Thus, it may be concluded that the proposed control technique of DVR, operated by adaptive fuzzy control scheme, may be justified for utilizing the same as a common sag mitigating device. Within the context of the present study, the work is ended with simulation only. However, the same may be tested on an experimental bench fuzzy-proportional-integral.   REFERENCES:  McGranaghan, M.F., Mueller, D.R., Samotyj, M.J.: ‘Voltage sags in industrial systems’, IEEE Trans.

http://asokatechnologies.in/hysteresis-current-control/,"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics, 2017 ABSTRACT: This paper presents a two degrees of freedom (2DOF) control scheme for voltage compensation in a dynamic voltage restorer (DVR). It commences with the model of the DVR power circuit, which is the starting point for the control design procedure. The control scheme is based on a 2DOF structure implemented in a stationary reference frame (α−β), with two nested controllers used to obtain a pass-band behavior of the closed-loop transfer function, and is capable of achieving both a balanced and an unbalanced voltage sag compensation. The 2DOF control has certain advantages with regard to traditional control methods, such as the possibility of ensuring that all the poles of the closed-loop transfer function are chosen without the need for observers and reducing the number of variables to be measured. The use of the well-known double control- loop schemes which employ feedback current controllers to reduce the resonance of the plant is, therefore, unnecessary. A simple control methodology permits the dynamic behavior of the system to be controlled and completely defines the location of the poles. Furthermore, extensive simulations and experimental results obtained using a 5 kW DVR laboratory prototype show the good performance of the proposed control strategy.   KEYWORDS:  Power Quality Dynamic Voltage Restorer (DVR) Control Design Resonant Controller Stationary Frame Controller Voltage Sag.    SOFTWARE: MATLAB/SIMULINK   BLOCK DIAGRAM:  Fig. 1.

The nested regulators provide the control with two degrees of freedom, and the control scheme is implemented in the stationary reference frame. Furthermore, in order to accomplish the requirements for voltage sag compensation, it is necessary to track the component at the fundamental frequency. This is achieved using a resonant term in one of the controllers. The proposed control design methodology is able to define all the poles of the closed-loop system without observers and with a reduction in the number of variables that must be measured, thus making it possible to avoid the use of the traditional current loop employed in control schemes for the DVR. The structure with the nested regulators achieves perfect zero tracking error at the nominal frequency and blocks the DC offset, signifying that it has some advantages over other control methods, such as double-loop schemes with proportional-resonant regulators. Moreover, the design methodology is thoroughly explained when the delay in the calculations is taken into account. In this case, the design procedure allows the dominant poles of the closed-loop system to be chosen. If the closed-loop poles are chosen carefully, this control structure can also be applied to other systems which require higher delays, e.g., power converter applications with a reduced switching frequency. The design methodology can additionally be extended to the discrete domain. Comprehensive simulated and experimental results corroborate the performance of the 2DOF-Resonant control scheme for balanced and unbalanced voltage sags. The proposed control scheme is able to compensate both types of voltage sags with a very fast transient response and an accurate tracking of the reference voltage, even when the different types of loads and frequency deviations of the grid voltages are considered. Extended comparisons with a PR controller using a double-loop scheme and a PR controller in a double loop with a Posicast regulator have been carried out, demonstrating that the performance of the 2DOF-Resonant controller is superior in all cases. Moreover, the study of the stability as regards parameter variations for the compared control schemes demonstrates the more robust behavior of the 2DOF-Resonant control scheme.   REFERENCES:  H. M.

This paper describes a method of reducing current ripple in a three phase grid connected inverter utilizing Proportional Resonance (PR) controller. The effectiveness of the PR current controller is demonstrated by comparing its performance with that of the Proportional Integral (PI) controller. Simulation and experimental results show that Proportional Resonance (PR) controller achieves better reduction in total harmonic distortion (THD) in the current signal spectrum.   KEYWORDS  Grid-connected inverter LCL filter PI controller PR controller.    SOFTWARE:MATLAB/SIMULINK    BLOCK DIAGRAM:  Fig.1.

The FFT of the phase current waveform using Proportional Resonance controller   CONCLUSION This paper has considered the impact of the current control scheme of a three-phase grid-connected inverter under normal and abnormal grid conditions using PI and PR controllers. In particular, this work has compared the performance of the industrially accepted PI controller, and the emerging PR controller which is popular in grid connected renewable energy applications. In keeping with the claims of other literature, simulation studies have confirmed that the PR controller shows better performance under normal operating conditions. There is no steady state error output, and the harmonic content of the current waveform is very low. Moreover, in this paper, the effect of grid voltage dips on the performance of the grid connected inverter was considered. Whilst the PI controller demonstrates very good performance, the Proportional Resonance controller offers superior output power regulation, and improved power quality performance. Overall, it suggests that the PR controller is better suited in the event of grid faults, or operation in weak grid environments.   REFERENCES  Wuhua and H.

http://asokatechnologies.in/proportional-resonance-controller/,"ABSTRACT The distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) provides fast control of active and reactive powers to enable load compensation, harmonics current elimination, voltage flicker mitigation, voltage and frequency regulation. This paper presents power quality improvement technique in the presence of grid disturbances and wind energy penetration using DSTATCOM with battery energy storage system. DSTATCOM control is provided based on synchronous reference frame theory. A modified IEEE 13 bus test feeder with DSTATCOM and wind generator is used for the study. Power quality events during grid disturbances such as feeder tripping and re-closing, voltage sag, swell and load switching have been studied in association with DSTATCOM. The power quality disturbances due to wind generator outage, synchronization and wind speed variations have also been investigated. The study has been carried out using MATLAB/SIMULINK and the simulation results are compared with real time results obtained by the use of real time digital simulator (RTDS) for validating the effectiveness of proposed methodology.

The DSTATCOM has been proposed to improve the power quality in the above events. The proposed DSTATCOM with SRF based control has been proved to be effective in improving the power quality in these events at grid level. The power quality events associated with wind operations such as wind generator outage, grid synchronization of wind generator and wind speed variations have been improved by the use of proposed DSTATCOM in the distribution network. From, these studies it has been established that the DSTATCOM can effectively be used to improve the power quality in the distribution network with wind generation and during grid disturbances. The results have been validated in real time utilizing RTDS. The real time results are very close to the simulation results which shows the effectiveness of proposed DSTATCOM with BESS for improvement of PQ in the distribution system.   REFERENCES  Ibrahim W, Morcos M.

There is no steady state error output, and the harmonic content of the current waveform is very low. In addition, the adaptive PR controller offers superior output power regulation, and improved power quality performance. Overall, it can be concluded that the adaptive PR controller is better suited in the event of grid faults, or operation in weak grid environments, compared to fix gain controllers.   REFERENCES:  Wuhua and H.

http://asokatechnologies.in/adaptive-pr-controller/,"ABSTRACT  The development of power electronics technology gives ample of opportunity for the grid integration of renewable in an efficient way. Commonly pulse width modulated voltage source inverter is widely used for this purpose. The control technique of grid integrated inverters plays a major role for the reduction of harmonic and improvement of power quality in the system. The most commonly used current control technique for the control of the inverter is hysteresis current controller strategies. But the main drawback hysteresis current controller is the uneven switching frequency and higher harmonic distortion. In this paper a hysteresis current controller with offset band for three phase grid integrated pulse width modulated voltage source inverter has been implemented for considerable reduction of harmonic distortion and better power quality. The MATLAB-Simulink environment is used to model, study and simulate the system.

THD for HCC with offset band CONCLUSION  The HCC with offset scheme is implemented to achieve lower THD and power quality improvement of the three phase grid connected PWM-VSI. The result obtained from simulation is compared with HCC system. The result reveals that the HCC with offset scheme has lower THD i.e. 2.10% as compared to HCC which is 3.22% and also the average switching frequency is less due to the zero level in the inverter output voltage. The another advantage of HCC with offset scheme is, average value of the current error is smaller as compared to HCC which can be verified by comparing the result of current error of both the schemes. It implies the power quality is superior in case of HCC with offset band.   REFERENCES   Falk, ,  “Prolog   to   renewable   energy   today   and   tomorrow,”  in Proceedings of the IEEE , vol.89, no.8, pp.1214-1215, Aug. 2001 Kroposki, B.; Pink, C.; DeBlasio, R.; Thomas, H.; Simões, M.; Sen, P.K., “Benefits of Power Electronic Interfaces for Distributed Energy Systems,” IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion, , vol.25, no.3, pp.901-908, Sept.

http://asokatechnologies.in/artificial-neural-network-based-dynamic-voltage-restorer/,"ABSTRACT: In this paper, a hysteresis current controller with reduced losses for three-phase grid-connected inverter is proposed. In the proposed hysteresis current controller, one of the inverter phase is clamped to the positive or negative inverter buses depending on the polarity of the phase current. Totally, each inverter phase is clamped for the duration of one third of the fundamental output period. As the inverter phase is inactive when the current is the highest, the switching losses are reduced. Simulation and experimental results are included to show the effectiveness of the proposed controller.   KEYWORDS:   Current controller Hysteresis Grid-connected inverter, Losses Clamped    SOFTWARE: MATLAB/SIMULINK    CIRCUIT DIAGRAM:  Fig. 1.

http://asokatechnologies.in/hysteresis-current-controller/,"IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity, 2017 ABSTRACT This paper presents the design and evaluation of a mini-size GdBCO magnet for hybrid energy storage (HES) application in a kW-class dynamic voltage restorer (DVR). The HES-based DVR concept integrates with one fast-response high power superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) unit and one low-cost high-capacity battery energy storage (BES) unit. Structural design, fabrication process and finite-element modeling (FEM) simulation of a 3.25 mH/240 A SMES magnet wound by state-of-the-art GdBCO tapes in SuNAM are presented. To avoid the internal soldering junctions and enhance the critical current of the magnet simultaneously, an improved continuous disk winding (CDW) method is proposed by introducing different gaps between adjacent single-pancake coil layers inside the magnet. About 4.41% increment in critical current and about 3.42% increment in energy storage capacity are demonstrated compared to a conventional CDW method. By integrating a 40 V/100 Ah valve-regulated lead-acid (VRLA) battery, the SMES magnet is applied to form a laboratory HES device for designing the kW-class DVR. For protecting a 380 V/5 kW sensitive load from 50% voltage sag, the SMES unit in the HES based scheme is demonstrated to avoid an initial discharge time delay of about 2.5 ms and a rushing discharging current of about 149.15 A in the sole BES based scheme, and the BES unit is more economically feasible than the sole SMES based scheme for extending the compensation time duration.   KEYWORDS:  Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) SMES magnet design Hybrid energy storage (HES), Battery energy storage (BES) Continuous disk winding (CDW) Dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) Voltage sag compensation.    SOFTWARE: MATLAB/SIMULINK   CIRCUIT DIAGRAM:  Fig. 1.

Transient current and power curves of the SMES and BES systems: (a) Operating current; (b) Output power.   CONCLUSION The structural design, fabrication process and FEM simulation of a 3.25 mH/240 A SMES magnet wound by state-of-the-art GdBCO tapes have been presented in this paper. The FEM simulation results have proved the performance enhancements in both the critical current and energy storage capacity by using the improved CDW scheme. Such a mini-size SMES magnet having relatively high power and low energy storage capacity is further applied to combine with a 40 V/100 Ah VRLA battery for developing a laboratory HES device in a kW-class DVR. In a 5 Kw sensitive load applications case, voltage sag compensation characteristics of three different DVR schemes by using a sole SMES system, a sole BES system and a SMES-BES-based HES device have been discussed and compared. With the fast-response high-power SMES, the maximum output current from the BES system is reduced from about 149.15 A in the BES-based DVR to 62.5 A in the HES-based DVR, and the drawback from the initial discharge time delay caused by the inevitable energy conversion process is offset by integrating the SMES system. With the low-cost high-capacity BES, practical compensation time duration is extended from about 32 ms in the SMES-based DVR to a longer duration determined by the BES capacity. Therefore, the proposed HES concept integrated with fast-response high-power SMES unit and low-cost high-capacity BES unit can be well expected to apply in practical large-scale DVR developments and other similar SMES applications.   REFERENCES   H.

http://asokatechnologies.in/6603-2/,"IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS, 2015 ABSTRACT: A distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) is used for load voltage regulation and its performance mainly depends upon the feeder impedance and its nature (resistive, inductive, stiff, non-stiff). However, a study for analyzing voltage regulation performance of DSTATCOM depending upon network parameters is not well defined. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive study of design, operation, and flexible control of a DSTATCOM operating in voltage control mode. A detailed analysis of the voltage regulation capability of DSTATCOM under various feeder impedances is presented. Then, a benchmark design procedure to compute the value of external inductor is presented. A dynamic reference load voltage generation scheme is also developed which allows DSTATCOM to compensate load reactive power during normal operation, in addition to providing voltage support during disturbances. Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

After providing a detailed exploration of voltage regulation capability of DSTATCOM under various feeder scenarios, a benchmark design procedure for selecting suitable value of external inductor is proposed. An algorithm is formulated for dynamic reference load voltage magnitude generation. The DSTATCOM has improved voltage regulation capability with a reduced current rating VSI, reduced losses in the VSI and feeder. Also, dynamic reference load voltage generation scheme allows DSTATCOM to set different constant reference voltage during voltage disturbances. Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution. The external inductor is a very simple and cheap solution for improving the voltage regulation, however it remains connected throughout the operation and continuous voltage drop across it occurs. The future work includes operation of this fixed inductor as a controlled reactor so that its effect can be minimized by varying its inductance. REFERENCES: [1] M. H.
